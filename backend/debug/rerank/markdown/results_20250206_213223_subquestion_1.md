### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** The text stresses the importance of post-inversion analysis with PEST utility software. It advocates for multiple runs, model revision for poor fits, and subjective evaluation of model-measurement misfit. Regularization, parameter reasonableness, and removal of insensitive parameters are crucial. Tools like EIGPROC, SSSTAT, and GENLINPRED assist in analysis, culminating in a final model run with optimized parameters or manual adjustments.
- **Detailed Summary:** This section emphasizes the importance of post-inversion analysis using PEST utility software for processing and inspecting results. It highlights the need for multiple PEST runs, model revision based on poor fits, and subjective analysis of model-measurement misfit. Regularization, parameter reasonableness, and manual removal of insensitive parameters for ill-posed problems are key. Various tools like EIGPROC, SSSTAT, GENLINPRED, PREDUNC7, SUPCALC, INFSTAT, INFSTAT1, PREDUNC5, SUPOBSPAR, and SUPOBSPAR1 aid in analysis. The process concludes with a final model run using optimized parameters or manual intervention if necessary.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** For highly parameterized models, excessive model runs for derivative calculations can be reduced by preventing premature higher-order derivative calculations (NOPTSWITCH), widening parameter bounds, using Tikhonov regularization, and setting an appropriate target objective function (Chapter 9).  Discontinuous model outputs may require global optimization methods (Chapter 16).  Parameter correlation/insensitivity (JtQJ non-invertible) is addressed by regularization, SVD, or LSQR.
- **Next Summary:** Inversion yields minimum error variance solutions, not necessarily "correct" parameter values.  Multiple PEST runs may be needed; poor initial fits suggest model revision.  Subjective analysis of model-measurement misfit (plots, contour comparisons) is crucial, acknowledging model imperfections and structural noise.  Regularization (PHIMLIM) controls fit, and parameter reasonableness is key for null-space-dependent predictions.

- **Subsection:** 8.1 Introduction

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST optimizes predictions while maintaining the objective function below a threshold, considering post-calibration uncertainty. It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.

This works best with few parameters and a well-posed inverse problem; otherwise, use linear analysis, Monte Carlo, or Pareto methods.  The method requires high-integrity derivatives and a prior calibration process.

All files use comma-delimited data except case.rns.  If all observation weights are zero, PESTPP-SEN resets them to 1.0.
- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-OPT solves constrained optimization problems considering uncertainties in model outputs (chance constraints).  Constraints are applied to predictive values adjusted for uncertainty (often pessimistically), using a calibrated model (minimized error variance, Doherty 2015) where model outputs are near the center of their posterior distributions.  Model parameter uncertainty stems from prior uncertainty and calibration data.

**8.1.2 Overview**

### Content
Sustainable management of a natural system often requires that an optimization problem be solved. Something must be maximized or minimized through adjustment of so-called ‚Äúdecision variables‚Äù, subject to certain constraints. For example, it may be desirable to maximize the amount of water extracted from a number of wells (where pumping rates are the decision variables), subject to the constraints that flow in an adjacent stream does not fall below a specified rate, and that groundwater levels in certain observation wells are maintained above certain levels. Design of a contaminant remediation system may attempt to ensure that the cost of water extraction and treatment is minimized subject to the constraint that the contaminant is captured; pumping and injection rates, and the locations of pumping and injection wells, comprise the decision variables in this example.
Models are used to predict the response of a natural system to natural and management-imposed stresses. Where management is optimized, some of the quantities which the model calculates comprise system behaviour on which constraints must be imposed. These outputs are normally uncertain, reflecting the fact that the model‚Äôs parameters are uncertain. (Model outputs to which constraints are applied have this in common with any other predictions made by a model.) The question then arises as to whether imposition of constraints should take account of these uncertainties. Where violation of a constraint can result in an unacceptable cost, the answer to that question is obvious: respect for valuable societal and/or environmental assets requires that model-calculated quantities to which constraints are applied be adjusted to include the range of possibilities that are compatible with the range of reasonable parameters that a model can employ. For example, in the stream flow example discussed above, exercise of the precautionary principle may dictate that the constraint be applied to the lowest streamflow that would be calculated by the model if it were parameterized with the most pessimistic set of parameters (with respect to that particular model output) that are compatible with expert knowledge on the one hand, and the necessity to fit the model calibration dataset on the other hand.
In most environmental modelling contexts, a model is calibrated before it is deployed. As is described by Doherty (2015), if properly undertaken, the calibration process yields a parameter field of minimized error variance. This is its ‚Äúpassport to uniqueness‚Äù. The parameter field is not correct; its potential for wrongness (which may be large) is merely minimized. Any prediction that the model makes inherits this status. That is, the prediction is not correct; however, its potential for wrongness has been minimized. Hence a prediction made by a calibrated model lies somewhere near the centre of the posterior probability distribution of that prediction. The same concept can be extended to model outputs that describe environmental behaviour to which constraints must be applied.
If uncertainty is to be taken into account in imposition of an optimization constraint, the width of the probability distribution associated with the model output to which the constraint is applied must be calculated so that the constraint can be applied to a predictive value that is adjusted in order to accommodate its uncertainty. Often (but not always ‚Äì see below) it will be adjusted towards the pessimistic end of its probability range.
PESTPP-OPT not only solves a constrained optimization problem. It solves a constrained optimization problem that accommodates uncertainties in model outputs to which constraints are applied. These are often referred to as ‚Äúchance constraints‚Äù. In applying chance constraints, PESTPP-OPT assumes that model predictive uncertainty is an outcome of model parameter uncertainty. The latter is, in turn, an outcome of prior parameter uncertainty (i.e., the uncertainty range that emerges from the stochastic nature of expert knowledge), and the extent to which this uncertainty is reduced through the model calibration process. Parameter uncertainty reduction is a function of the information content of the calibration dataset, and the extent to which flow of this information is hampered by the presence of noise within that dataset.

- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-OPT handles chance constraints via weights (as standard deviations, *opt_std_weights(true)*), linear methods (FOSM, using Jacobian matrices and prior parameter/measurement uncertainties), or stack-based methods.  FOSM uses Equations 8.1a or 8.1b (Doherty 2015) to calculate prediction variance;  Equations 8.2a or 8.2b calculate the posterior parameter covariance matrix; Equation 8.3 calculates output uncertainty variance.  The Jacobian matrix can be user-supplied or calculated by PESTPP-OPT.
