## lamforgive

**Definition & Purpose:**  
`lamforgive` is a control variable in PEST that dictates how the software should respond to model run failures during the process of adjusting the Marquardt lambda (λ) for parameter estimation. When set to `lamforgive`, PEST is instructed to ignore failed model runs and attempt further parameter upgrades using other values of the Marquardt lambda. This is particularly useful in stages of the parameter estimation process where the model is provided with parameter sets that are significantly different from previous iterations, increasing the likelihood of model run failures.

**Configuration Details:**  
`lamforgive` should be placed on the fifth line of the "control data" section of the PEST control file, following the `JACUPDATE` variable if present, or the `NUMLAM` variable if `JACUPDATE` is absent. It can also be placed in front of the `JACUPDATE` variable if desired. It must be supplied as either "lamforgive" to activate model run failure forgiveness or "nolamforgive" to deactivate it. If omitted, the default behavior is "nolamforgive".

**Valid Options:**  
- "lamforgive": Activates model run failure forgiveness.
- "nolamforgive": Deactivates model run failure forgiveness (default).

**Impact & Best Practices:**  
Activating `lamforgive` allows PEST to continue its parameter estimation process without being halted by model run failures, which can be common during the lambda adjustment phase. This setting is recommended in most deployment contexts to enhance the robustness of the optimization process. However, users should be aware that this may lead to the exploration of parameter spaces that cause model instability.

**Known Limitations:**  
While `lamforgive` can increase the efficiency of the parameter estimation process by avoiding unnecessary terminations, it may also lead to overlooking potential issues with the model setup or with certain parameter values that cause the model to fail.

## derforgive

**Definition & Purpose:**  
`derforgive` is another control variable in PEST that governs the software's behavior during model runs undertaken for the purpose of finite-difference derivatives calculation. When set to `derforgive`, PEST will handle model run failures by assigning a value of zero to the partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to the incrementally-varied parameter associated with the failed model run. This approach allows PEST to continue the optimization process despite the inability to calculate certain derivatives due to model run failures.

**Configuration Details:**  
Similar to `lamforgive`, `derforgive` must be placed on the fifth line of the "control data" section of the PEST control file, following `NUMLAM`. It must be supplied as either "derforgive" to activate this behavior or "noderforgive" to deactivate it. If omitted, the default setting is "noderforgive".

**Valid Options:**  
- "derforgive": Activates forgiveness for derivative calculation failures by setting derivatives to zero.
- "noderforgive": Deactivates forgiveness for derivative calculation failures (default).

**Impact & Best Practices:**  
Using `derforgive` can be particularly useful in maintaining the continuity of the optimization process, especially in complex models where certain parameter combinations may lead to non-convergence or other issues preventing successful model runs. It allows PEST to bypass the challenges associated with failed derivative calculations, albeit at the potential cost of less accurate sensitivity analysis.

**Known Limitations:**  
Relying on `derforgive` may result in inaccuracies in the estimation of parameter sensitivities, as failed derivative calculations are simply set to zero. This could potentially affect the quality of the parameter estimation process, especially if such failures are frequent.

### Follow-Up Questions:
1. How does setting `lamforgive` to "lamforgive" impact the convergence of the PEST optimization process?
2. What are the potential risks or downsides of using `derforgive` in complex groundwater models?
3. Can `lamforgive` and `derforgive` be used simultaneously, and if so, under what circumstances would this be recommended?

## LAMFORGIVE
**Definition & Purpose:**  
LAMFORGIVE, when set to "lamforgive", instructs PEST to take specific actions if, after several attempts (usually four), no lambda value leads to a successful parameter upgrade that allows the model to complete execution. The actions include switching to central derivatives calculation or ceasing execution altogether. This feature is designed to handle situations where the model fails to run with the updated parameter sets.

**Configuration Details:**  
LAMFORGIVE is configured in the "control data" section of the PEST control file, specifically on the fifth line following NUMLAM. It must be explicitly set to "lamforgive" or "nolamforgive", with "nolamforgive" being the default behavior if LAMFORGIVE is omitted.

**Valid Options:**  
- "lamforgive": Switch to central derivatives or stop execution upon repeated lambda failure.
- "nolamforgive": The default behavior where such specific forgiveness is not applied.

**Impact & Best Practices:**  
Setting LAMFORGIVE to "lamforgive" can be useful in scenarios where the model is sensitive to parameter changes, and finding a successful lambda is challenging. It allows for a more graceful handling of model run failures, potentially saving computational resources and time by avoiding repeated unsuccessful runs.

**Known Limitations:**  
Using "lamforgive" may not resolve the underlying issues causing the model run failures and could lead to the cessation of the model calibration process without achieving a successful parameter update.

`File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Section: 4.2.6 Fifth Line`

## DERFORGIVE
**Definition & Purpose:**  
DERFORGIVE governs PEST's behavior during model runs for the purpose of finite-difference derivatives calculation. When set to "derforgive", it allows PEST to handle failures in derivative calculation by setting the derivatives to zero and reporting missing files, rather than stopping execution.

**Configuration Details:**  
Similar to LAMFORGIVE, DERFORGIVE is configured on the fifth line of the "control data" section in the PEST control file, after NUMLAM. It must be set to either "derforgive" or "noderforgive". If omitted, "noderforgive" is assumed, preserving normal PEST behavior.

**Valid Options:**  
- "derforgive": Sets derivatives to zero and reports missing files upon model run failure during derivatives calculation.
- "noderforgive": Makes one attempt to repeat the model run using identical parameter values before ceasing execution with an error message upon failure.

**Impact & Best Practices:**  
Using "derforgive" can be beneficial in maintaining the continuity of the calibration process, especially in complex models where certain parameter combinations may lead to model run failures specifically during the derivatives calculation phase. It allows PEST to proceed with calibration despite these failures.

**Known Limitations:**  
Setting derivatives to zero may impact the accuracy of the calibration by potentially ignoring significant parameter sensitivities, especially if the failures are not uniformly distributed across the parameter space.

### Follow-Up Questions:
1. How does setting LAMFORGIVE to "lamforgive" affect the overall stability and convergence of the PEST calibration process?
2. What are the implications of using DERFORGIVE with "derforgive" on the accuracy of the derived parameter sensitivities in PEST?
3. Can DERFORGIVE and LAMFORGIVE settings be optimized dynamically during a PEST run to improve model calibration outcomes?
