## What is 'lamforgive'?

**Direct Answer:**  
`lamforgive` is a control variable in PEST that instructs PEST on how to handle model run failures during the lambda search process. If set to "lamforgive", PEST either switches to central derivatives calculation or ceases execution altogether if, after a few attempts (normally four), no lambda value leads to an upgraded parameter set that allows the model to complete execution. This variable is part of the "control data" section in the PEST control file.

**Technical Format:**

- **Definition & Purpose:** `lamforgive` is designed to provide a mechanism for PEST to manage situations where the model fails to run to completion due to the parameter sets derived during the lambda search process. It aims to either continue the optimization process by switching to an alternative calculation method (central derivatives) or to stop the process with an appropriate error message, depending on the outcome of repeated lambda testing attempts.
  
- **Configuration Details:** This variable is located in the "control data" section of the PEST control file. It must be supplied as either "lamforgive" to activate model run failure forgiveness or "nolamforgive" to deactivate it. If omitted, PEST defaults to "nolamforgive".

- **Valid Options:** The valid settings for `lamforgive` are "lamforgive" and "nolamforgive".

- **Impact & Best Practices:** Setting `lamforgive` to "lamforgive" can be particularly useful in complex models or in situations where the model is sensitive to certain parameter values, potentially leading to frequent run failures during the optimization process. It allows PEST to attempt to find a solution despite these failures, either by trying a different approach to calculating derivatives or by stopping the process before too many unsuccessful attempts accumulate.

- **Known Limitations:** While `lamforgive` can help manage model run failures, it may also lead to the cessation of the optimization process if no suitable lambda value is found after several attempts. This could potentially prevent PEST from finding a solution even if one might be attainable with more attempts or with a different configuration.

### ü§î Follow-Up Questions:
1. How does PEST determine the number of attempts before activating `lamforgive`?
2. What are the implications of switching to central derivatives calculation when `lamforgive` is activated?
3. Can `lamforgive` be used in conjunction with other control variables to enhance model calibration stability?

## DERFORGIVE

**Definition & Purpose:**  
DERFORGIVE is a control variable in PEST that dictates how the software handles failures during model runs for the purpose of finite-difference derivatives calculation. It can be set to either "derforgive" or "noderforgive". When set to "derforgive", PEST assigns a value of zero to the partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to incrementally-varied parameters if a model run failure occurs. This allows PEST to continue its parameter estimation process even in the face of model run failures that would otherwise halt the process.

**Configuration Details:**  
DERFORGIVE is located in the "control data" section of the PEST control file, specifically on the fifth line after NUMLAM. It is an optional variable; if omitted, PEST assumes a default value of "noderforgive".

**Valid Options:**  
- "derforgive": Assigns a value of zero to partial derivatives upon model run failure and reports missing model output files.
- "noderforgive" (default): Preserves normal PEST behavior, attempting to rerun the model with identical parameters before ceasing execution with an error message upon repeated failure.

**Impact & Best Practices:**  
Setting DERFORGIVE to "derforgive" can be particularly useful in complex models where certain parameter sets may lead to non-convergence or other issues that prevent a successful model run. This setting allows PEST to bypass these failures, treating them as zero derivatives, which can be crucial for continuing the optimization process without manual intervention. However, it's important to carefully consider the implications of ignoring these failures, as they may indicate underlying issues with the model or the parameter space being explored.

**Known Limitations:**  
While DERFORGIVE can help in maintaining the continuity of the parameter estimation process, it also means that certain model run failures are essentially ignored, which might lead to less accurate or meaningful optimization results. Users should analyze the context of these failures to ensure that they are not systematically affecting the estimation process.
