**3.1 General**

### Content
This chapter provides an overview of what PEST does. A general understanding of its operations is required before its operational details can be explained, and before descriptions can be provided of ways in which you can alter its operational details to suit your own modelling and inversion purposes.
All of the theory on which PEST and its utility support software is based is presented in Doherty (2015) (i.e. the “PEST book”) and will not be repeated in this manual. However, where necessary, equations from the PEST book will be cited herein so that you can easily relate aspects of PEST’s operations to the theory which supports them.
Where applicable, variables which control the way in which PEST performs will be mentioned in the following overview. These variables reside in the PEST control file. While later chapters will describe this file in detail, it is introduced below to set a context for the subject matter of the present chapter.
As was discussed in the introduction to this text, utility software which supports and compliments the use of PEST is documented in part II of this manual. Part I of the PEST manual (i.e. the document that you are reading right now) describes PEST itself, the global SCEUA_P and CMAES_P optimisers, and the very basic SENSAN sensitivity analyser.

### Summary
**PEST requires text-based model output files; binary files need an ASCII translator.  Instead of templates, instruction files guide PEST to extract observations using markers (primary for lines, secondary for positions within a line).  Observations can be linked to markers, simplifying extraction.  The file top is the default marker.**

### Header
**2.3.2 How PEST Reads a Model Output File**

### Content
PEST must be taught how to read a model output file and identify the numbers it must extract from that file. For this to happen, model output files read by PEST must be text files; PEST cannot read a binary file. If your model produces only binary files, you will need to write a simple program which reads this binary data and rewrites it in ASCII form; PEST can then search the ASCII file for the numbers it needs.
Unfortunately, a number cannot be read from model output files using the template concept. This is because many models cannot be relied upon to produce an output file of identical structure on each model run. For example, a model which calculates the underground stress regime in the vicinity of a tunnel may employ an iterative numerical solution scheme for which different numbers of iterations are required to achieve numerical convergence depending on the boundary conditions and material properties supplied for a particular run. If the model records on its output file the convergence history of the solution process, and the results of its stress calculations are recorded on the lines following this, the latter may be displaced downwards depending on the number of iterations required to calculate them.
So instead of using an output file template, you must provide PEST with a list of instructions on how to find observations on an output file. Basically, PEST finds observations on a model output file in the same way that a person does. A person runs his/her eye down the file looking for something which he/she recognises - a “marker”; if this marker is properly selected, observations can usually be linked to it in a simple manner. For example, if you are looking for the outcome of the above stress model’s deliberations at an elapsed time of 100 days, you may instruct PEST to read its output file looking for the marker STRESS CALCULATED AT FINITE ELEMENT NODES: ELAPSED TIME = 100 DAYS.
A particular outcome for which you have a corresponding field measurement may then be found, for example, between character positions 23 and 30 on the 4th line following the above marker, or as the 5th item on the 3rd line after the marker, etc. Note that for simple models, especially “home-made”, single-purpose models where little development time has been invested in highly descriptive output files, no markers may be necessary, the default initial marker being the top of the file.
Markers can be of either primary or secondary type. PEST uses a primary marker as it scans the model output file line by line, looking for a reference point for subsequent observation identification or further scanning. A secondary marker is used for a reference point as a single line is examined from left to right.

### Summary
**PEST is advanced software for environmental model calibration and uncertainty analysis.  It acknowledges model parameter and prediction uncertainties, supporting decisions by identifying unlikely future events rather than predicting certain outcomes.  Used with other software, PEST quantifies uncertainties and helps decision-making by embracing real-world complexity.  Doherty (2015) provides theoretical background.**

### Header
**1.4 Philosophy**

### Content
At the time of writing, the PEST suite is by far the most advanced software available for environmental model calibration, and for post-calibration uncertainty analysis. As such, it holds a unique place in the environmental industry – not just for what it can do, but for what it can teach us about environmental modelling.
PEST, and its ancillary software, embraces the fact that environmental systems are complex, and that a model’s parameters and predictions are uncertain. Its use supports the critical notion that a model can never tell us what will happen in the future following adoption of a certain environmental management practice; this is an outcome of the uncertainties associated with most model predictions of environmental interest. However a model may tell us, with a high degree of confidence, what will NOT happen in the future. In order to accomplish this, it cannot be deployed on its own; instead it must be deployed in conjunction with high-end inversion software such as PEST. Under these circumstances models may then provide invaluable support to the decision-making process by allowing rejection of hypotheses that unwanted events will occur if certain courses of management action are taken. (These courses of management action will often include installation of monitoring systems which trigger responses to the crossing of pre-defined measurement thresholds.)
It follows that a model, as a simulator, does not constitute a decision-support tool. In contrast, the model, as a simulator, should constitute one of a number of software packages, which are used in partnership to
- quantify the uncertainties associated with predictions of management interest, and
- reduce those uncertainties to a level that is commensurate with information available from expert knowledge on the one hand and the historical behaviour of a system on the other hand.
Software packages used in concert to achieve these ends collectively constitute an indispensable tool for decision-support – a tool which embraces the complexity of the real world at the same time as it provides decision-makers with an understanding of the ramifications of that complexity for the decisions that they must make.
For a full discussion of the role of models in decision-making see Doherty and Simmons (2013) and Doherty and Vogwill (2016).
1.5 PEST- The Book
The following book can be downloaded from the PEST web site:
Doherty, J., 2015. Calibration and uncertainty analysis for complex environmental models. Published by Watermark Numerical Computing, Brisbane, Australia. 227pp, ISBN: 978-0-9943786-0-6
The numerous references to Doherty (2015) throughout this manual are to this text.
Doherty (2015) covers in details all of the theory embodied in PEST and its utility support software. It also discusses the ramifications of this theory for how models should be used in real-world environmental decision-making. It provides an extensive discussion on the theory and practice of regularisation – whether this is done manually through parameter simplification, or mathematically using subspace or Tikhonov methods. It also provides a critique of manual regularisation, and provides an in-depth discussion on why it is important to reflect environmental system complexity in model parameterisation complexity if models are to play a useful role in support of environmental decision-making. It shows how parameter nonuniqueness is not something to run away from, but something to embrace; after all, it is the parameters that cannot be estimated that contribute most to predictive uncertainty - generally much more than those which can be estimated. It demonstrates that the use of many parameters in an inversion problem does not necessarily lead to over-fitting; nor does it promulgate numerical instability, or result in solutions to the inverse problem which are unnecessarily complex. The book shows that parameter simplification is fundamental to achievement of a unique solution to an inverse problem, and that achievement of parameter simplification through mathematical means leads to reduction of potential for model predictive error at the same time as it allows quantification of this potential for error.
Parts I and II of this manual refer to the above book extensively. They do not repeat the theory presented in the book; nor do they discuss the ramifications of that theory for model deployment in the decision-making context. This enables these manuals to be somewhat shorter than they would otherwise be; it also enables them to concentrate on implementation details. As a PEST user, you are strongly advised to read the book, for this will provide you with the theoretical basis that you need to get the most out of PEST.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PEST, a model-independent parameter estimation program, calibrates models by matching outputs to measurements.  It handles model calibration's inherent non-uniqueness through regularization.  The suite also assesses parameter and predictive uncertainty using linear and nonlinear methods, including null space Monte Carlo, and analyzes model defects' effects on predictions.
- **Next Summary:** PEST runs models via system calls, requiring command-line accessibility; ideally, the model's directory should be in the PATH variable.  PEST can handle models run via batch files or scripts, including pre- and post-processors and multiple simulators.  To prevent errors, batch files should delete intermediate files.  The "start /w" command (Windows) prevents premature PEST output file checks, and keyboard input can be redirected from a text file.

### Summary
**Parallel PEST uses a PAGENT agent program on each model-running machine.  PAGENT, started before Parallel PEST, receives signals from PEST to run the model (user-specified command) and signals completion.  The model command may differ per machine.**

### Header
**11.2.2 The Parallel PEST Agent Program**

### Content
While Parallel PEST is able to achieve access to model input and output files residing on other machines through the use of shared folders, it cannot actually run the model on another machine; only a program running on the other machine can do that. Hence before PEST commences execution, an “agent” program must be started on each machine on which the model will run. Whenever PEST wishes to run a model in a particular folder on a particular machine it signals the agent running in that folder on that machine to start the model. Once the model has finished execution the agent signals PEST that the model run is complete. PEST can then read the output file(s) generated by the model.
The agent program (named PAGENT) must be started before Parallel PEST in each folder on each machine on which model runs are to be undertaken. It detects the commencement of PEST execution through reading a signal sent by PEST as the latter starts up. It then awaits an order by PEST to commence a model run, upon the arrival of which it sends a command to its local system to start the model. It is possible that the command used to start the model may be different for different agent machines (for example if the model executable resides in a differently-named folder on each such machine and the full model pathname is used in issuing the system command); hence PAGENT prompts the user for the local model command as it commences execution.

- **Subsection:** 11.2 Parallel PEST – Concepts and Specifications

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Parallel PEST and BEOPEST parallelize model runs to reduce run time. Parallel PEST needs a run management file, while BEOPEST's is optional. Both distribute runs to available machines, with BEOPEST using faster TCP/IP communication. Parallel PEST uses PAGENT agents, requires separate folders for agents, and shared signal files for communication. BEOPEST offers ease of use, faster communication, flexibility, and support for multiple command lines and surrogate models.
- **Detailed Summary:** Parallel PEST distributes model runs across networked machines, using a PAGENT agent program on each machine. It requires separate folders for agents to avoid file conflicts and uses shared signal files for communication. The run management file lists agents, runtimes, and filenames. Parallel PEST partially parallelizes Marquardt lambda testing, potentially leading to different solution paths.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Parallel PEST extends single-machine operation by distributing model runs across networked machines.  It writes model input files (using templates) and reads model output files (using instruction files) on the PEST machine, assuming read/write access to files on all machines via standard filename protocols.
- **Next Summary:** For optimal Parallel PEST performance, independent model executables should reside on each agent machine.  Agents must use separate folders to avoid overwriting input/output files.  Copying the entire model working folder simplifies setup when input/output files are in a single folder.  The manager machine commonly also acts as an agent machine.

### Summary
**In "predictive analysis" mode (see Doherty 2015, section 8.4), PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction while keeping the objective function below a threshold (Φ0, slightly above minimum Φmin). This method is suitable for well-behaved models with few parameters; otherwise, other methods are recommended.**

### Header
**3.3.4 Predictive Analysis Mode**

### Content
When PEST is run in “predictive analysis” mode it solves a constrained maximisation/minimisation problem in which a prediction of interest is maximised or minimised subject to the constraint that the objective function rises no higher than a user-specified level. Theory on which this mode of PEST’s operation is based was derived by Cooley and Vecchia (1987) and Vecchia and Cooley (1987), and is described in detail in section 8.4 of Doherty (2015).
Use of PEST in “predictive analysis” mode should follow solution of a well posed, or only slightly ill-posed, inverse problem in which a model has been calibrated through reduction of an appropriate objective function to its minimum. Let us denote this minimised objective function as Φmin. Let Φ0 denote an objective function that is slightly higher than Φmin at which the model is deemed to be “uncalibrated” at a certain level of confidence. Let model output read by PEST that is actually a prediction, and is hence unused by the calibration process. The range of post-calibration uncertainty of this prediction can be determined through solution of two constrained optimisation problems in which the prediction is maximised, and then minimized, subject to the constraint that the objective.
This means of assessing predictive uncertainty can work well where a model does not have too many parameters, and where it is numerically well-behaved so that finite-difference-based derivatives of model outputs with respect to parameters have a high degree of integrity. If these conditions are not met then other methods of predictive uncertainty assessment should be pursued; these can include linear methods, null space Monte Carlo, and PEST’s “pareto” mode.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** This chapter introduces PEST, a tool for solving inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST is a tool that iteratively solves inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses Jacobian matrices and Marquardt lambda for parameter estimation. Different methods are employed based on problem types, with options for uncertainty analysis and parallel processing to reduce computational costs.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PEST's "regularisation" mode uses Tikhonov regularization (see Doherty 2015), employing measurement and regularization objective functions.  A parameter covariance matrix is not recorded; however, posterior uncertainties are investigated using utilities like PREDUNC7.
- **Next Summary:** In "pareto" mode, PEST explores the trade-off between objective functions (e.g., measurement vs. regularization, or data fit vs. prediction proximity).  This allows assessment of fit quality and hypothesis testing regarding predictions (see Doherty 2015, section 8.5).  Parallel processing and SVD-assist mitigate computational costs.  Linear uncertainty analysis is possible using PEST utilities.

However a model may tell us, with a high degree of confidence, what will NOT happen in the future. In order to accomplish this, it cannot be deployed on its own; instead it must be deployed in conjunction with high-end inversion software such as PEST. Under these circumstances models may then provide invaluable support to the decision-making process by allowing rejection of hypotheses that unwanted events will occur if certain courses of management action are taken. (These courses of management action will often include installation of monitoring systems which trigger responses to the crossing of pre-defined measurement thresholds.)
It follows that a model, as a simulator, does not constitute a decision-support tool. In contrast, the model, as a simulator, should constitute one of a number of software packages, which are used in partnership to
- quantify the uncertainties associated with predictions of management interest, and
- reduce those uncertainties to a level that is commensurate with information available from expert knowledge on the one hand and the historical behaviour of a system on the other hand.
Software packages used in concert to achieve these ends collectively constitute an indispensable tool for decision-support – a tool which embraces the complexity of the real world at the same time as it provides decision-makers with an understanding of the ramifications of that complexity for the decisions that they must make.

The numerous references to Doherty (2015) throughout this manual are to this text.
Doherty (2015) covers in details all of the theory embodied in PEST and its utility support software. It also discusses the ramifications of this theory for how models should be used in real-world environmental decision-making. It provides an extensive discussion on the theory and practice of regularisation – whether this is done manually through parameter simplification, or mathematically using subspace or Tikhonov methods. It also provides a critique of manual regularisation, and provides an in-depth discussion on why it is important to reflect environmental system complexity in model parameterisation complexity if models are to play a useful role in support of environmental decision-making. It shows how parameter nonuniqueness is not something to run away from, but something to embrace; after all, it is the parameters that cannot be estimated that contribute most to predictive uncertainty - generally much more than those which can be estimated. It demonstrates that the use of many parameters in an inversion problem does not necessarily lead to over-fitting; nor does it promulgate numerical instability, or result in solutions to the inverse problem which are unnecessarily complex. The book shows that parameter simplification is fundamental to achievement of a unique solution to an inverse problem, and that achievement of parameter simplification through mathematical means leads to reduction of potential for model predictive error at the same time as it allows quantification of this potential for error.
Parts I and II of this manual refer to the above book extensively. They do not repeat the theory presented in the book; nor do they discuss the ramifications of that theory for model deployment in the decision-making context. This enables these manuals to be somewhat shorter than they would otherwise be; it also enables them to concentrate on implementation details. As a PEST user, you are strongly advised to read the book, for this will provide you with the theoretical basis that you need to get the most out of PEST.

### Summary
**Parallel PEST uses a PAGENT agent program on each model-running machine.  PAGENT, started before Parallel PEST, receives signals from PEST to run the model (user-specified command) and signals completion.  The model command may differ per machine.**

### Header
**11.2.2 The Parallel PEST Agent Program**

### Content
While Parallel PEST is able to achieve access to model input and output files residing on other machines through the use of shared folders, it cannot actually run the model on another machine; only a program running on the other machine can do that. Hence before PEST commences execution, an “agent” program must be started on each machine on which the model will run. Whenever PEST wishes to run a model in a particular folder on a particular machine it signals the agent running in that folder on that machine to start the model. Once the model has finished execution the agent signals PEST that the model run is complete. PEST can then read the output file(s) generated by the model.
The agent program (named PAGENT) must be started before Parallel PEST in each folder on each machine on which model runs are to be undertaken. It detects the commencement of PEST execution through reading a signal sent by PEST as the latter starts up. It then awaits an order by PEST to commence a model run, upon the arrival of which it sends a command to its local system to start the model. It is possible that the command used to start the model may be different for different agent machines (for example if the model executable resides in a differently-named folder on each such machine and the full model pathname is used in issuing the system command); hence PAGENT prompts the user for the local model command as it commences execution.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Parallel PEST and BEOPEST parallelize model runs to reduce run time. Parallel PEST needs a run management file, while BEOPEST's is optional. Both distribute runs to available machines, with BEOPEST using faster TCP/IP communication. Parallel PEST uses PAGENT agents, requires separate folders for agents, and shared signal files for communication. BEOPEST offers ease of use, faster communication, flexibility, and support for multiple command lines and surrogate models.
- **Detailed Summary:** Parallel PEST distributes model runs across networked machines, using a PAGENT agent program on each machine. It requires separate folders for agents to avoid file conflicts and uses shared signal files for communication. The run management file lists agents, runtimes, and filenames. Parallel PEST partially parallelizes Marquardt lambda testing, potentially leading to different solution paths.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Parallel PEST extends single-machine operation by distributing model runs across networked machines.  It writes model input files (using templates) and reads model output files (using instruction files) on the PEST machine, assuming read/write access to files on all machines via standard filename protocols.
- **Next Summary:** For optimal Parallel PEST performance, independent model executables should reside on each agent machine.  Agents must use separate folders to avoid overwriting input/output files.  Copying the entire model working folder simplifies setup when input/output files are in a single folder.  The manager machine commonly also acts as an agent machine.

### Summary
**In "predictive analysis" mode (see Doherty 2015, section 8.4), PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction while keeping the objective function below a threshold (Φ0, slightly above minimum Φmin). This method is suitable for well-behaved models with few parameters; otherwise, other methods are recommended.**

### Header
**3.3.4 Predictive Analysis Mode**

### Content
When PEST is run in “predictive analysis” mode it solves a constrained maximisation/minimisation problem in which a prediction of interest is maximised or minimised subject to the constraint that the objective function rises no higher than a user-specified level. Theory on which this mode of PEST’s operation is based was derived by Cooley and Vecchia (1987) and Vecchia and Cooley (1987), and is described in detail in section 8.4 of Doherty (2015).
Use of PEST in “predictive analysis” mode should follow solution of a well posed, or only slightly ill-posed, inverse problem in which a model has been calibrated through reduction of an appropriate objective function to its minimum. Let us denote this minimised objective function as Φmin. Let Φ0 denote an objective function that is slightly higher than Φmin at which the model is deemed to be “uncalibrated” at a certain level of confidence. Let model output read by PEST that is actually a prediction, and is hence unused by the calibration process. The range of post-calibration uncertainty of this prediction can be determined through solution of two constrained optimisation problems in which the prediction is maximised, and then minimized, subject to the constraint that the objective.
This means of assessing predictive uncertainty can work well where a model does not have too many parameters, and where it is numerically well-behaved so that finite-difference-based derivatives of model outputs with respect to parameters have a high degree of integrity. If these conditions are not met then other methods of predictive uncertainty assessment should be pursued; these can include linear methods, null space Monte Carlo, and PEST’s “pareto” mode.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** This chapter introduces PEST, a tool for solving inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST is a tool that iteratively solves inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses Jacobian matrices and Marquardt lambda for parameter estimation. Different methods are employed based on problem types, with options for uncertainty analysis and parallel processing to reduce computational costs.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PEST's "regularisation" mode uses Tikhonov regularization (see Doherty 2015), employing measurement and regularization objective functions.  A parameter covariance matrix is not recorded; however, posterior uncertainties are investigated using utilities like PREDUNC7.
- **Next Summary:** In "pareto" mode, PEST explores the trade-off between objective functions (e.g., measurement vs. regularization, or data fit vs. prediction proximity).  This allows assessment of fit quality and hypothesis testing regarding predictions (see Doherty 2015, section 8.5).  Parallel processing and SVD-assist mitigate computational costs.  Linear uncertainty analysis is possible using PEST utilities.

Control variables (detailed later) affect PEST's operation.  Part I covers PEST, SCEUA_P, CMAES_P, and SENSAN; Part II covers supporting utilities.**\n\n### Header\n**3.1 General**\n\n### Content\nThis chapter provides an overview of what PEST does. A general understanding of its operations is required before its operational details can be explained, and before descriptions can be provided of ways in which you can alter its operational details to suit your own modelling and inversion purposes.\nAll of the theory on which PEST and its utility support software is based is presented in Doherty (2015) (i.e. the “PEST book”) and will not be repeated in this manual. However, where necessary, equations from the PEST book will be cited herein so that you can easily relate aspects of PEST’s operations to the theory which supports them.\nWhere applicable, variables which control the way in which PEST performs will be mentioned in the following overview. These variables reside in the PEST control file. While later chapters will describe this file in detail, it is introduced below to set a context for the subject matter of the present chapter.\nAs was discussed in the introduction to this text, utility software which supports and compliments the use of PEST is documented in part II of this manual. Part I of the PEST manual (i.e. the document that you are reading right now) describes PEST itself, the global SCEUA_P and CMAES_P optimisers, and the very basic SENSAN sensitivity analyser.\n\n### Source\n- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation.

Instead of templates, instruction files guide PEST to extract observations using markers (primary for lines, secondary for positions within a line).  Observations can be linked to markers, simplifying extraction.  The file top is the default marker.**\n\n### Header\n**2.3.2 How PEST Reads a Model Output File**\n\n### Content\nPEST must be taught how to read a model output file and identify the numbers it must extract from that file. For this to happen, model output files read by PEST must be text files; PEST cannot read a binary file. If your model produces only binary files, you will need to write a simple program which reads this binary data and rewrites it in ASCII form; PEST can then search the ASCII file for the numbers it needs.\nUnfortunately, a number cannot be read from model output files using the template concept. This is because many models cannot be relied upon to produce an output file of identical structure on each model run. For example, a model which calculates the underground stress regime in the vicinity of a tunnel may employ an iterative numerical solution scheme for which different numbers of iterations are required to achieve numerical convergence depending on the boundary conditions and material properties supplied for a particular run. If the model records on its output file the convergence history of the solution process, and the results of its stress calculations are recorded on the lines following this, the latter may be displaced downwards depending on the number of iterations required to calculate them.\nSo instead of using an output file template, you must provide PEST with a list of instructions on how to find observations on an output file. Basically, PEST finds observations on a model output file in the same way that a person does. A person runs his/her eye down the file looking for something which he/she recognises - a “marker”; if this marker is properly selected, observations can usually be linked to it in a simple manner. For example, if you are looking for the outcome of the above stress model’s deliberations at an elapsed time of 100 days, you may instruct PEST to read its output file looking for the marker STRESS CALCULATED AT FINITE ELEMENT NODES: ELAPSED TIME = 100 DAYS.\nA particular outcome for which you have a corresponding field measurement may then be found, for example, between character positions 23 and 30 on the 4th line following the above marker, or as the 5th item on the 3rd line after the marker, etc. Note that for simple models, especially “home-made”, single-purpose models where little development time has been invested in highly descriptive output files, no markers may be necessary, the default initial marker being the top of the file.\nMarkers can be of either primary or secondary type. PEST uses a primary marker as it scans the model output file line by line, looking for a reference point for subsequent observation identification or further scanning. A secondary marker is used for a reference point as a single line is examined from left to right.\n\n### Source\n- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation.

It writes model input files (using templates) and reads model output files (using instruction files) on the PEST machine, assuming read/write access to files on all machines via standard filename protocols.\n- **Next Summary:** For optimal Parallel PEST performance, independent model executables should reside on each agent machine.  Agents must use separate folders to avoid overwriting input/output files.  Copying the entire model working folder simplifies setup when input/output files are in a single folder.  The manager machine commonly also acts as an agent machine.\n\n### Metadata\n- **Keywords:** \n- **Chunk ID:** 71f1d3021930\n- **Chunk Index:** 1\n- **Previous Chunk ID:** 40549ef92a55\n- **Next Chunk ID:** 2554c644461d\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\n### Summary\n**In \"predictive analysis\" mode (see Doherty 2015, section 8.4), PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction while keeping the objective function below a threshold (Φ0, slightly above minimum Φmin). This method is suitable for well-behaved models with few parameters; otherwise, other methods are recommended.**\n\n### Header\n**3.3.4 Predictive Analysis Mode**\n\n### Content\nWhen PEST is run in “predictive analysis” mode it solves a constrained maximisation/minimisation problem in which a prediction of interest is maximised or minimised subject to the constraint that the objective function rises no higher than a user-specified level. Theory on which this mode of PEST’s operation is based was derived by Cooley and Vecchia (1987) and Vecchia and Cooley (1987), and is described in detail in section 8.4 of Doherty (2015).\nUse of PEST in “predictive analysis” mode should follow solution of a well posed, or only slightly ill-posed, inverse problem in which a model has been calibrated through reduction of an appropriate objective function to its minimum. Let us denote this minimised objective function as Φmin. Let Φ0 denote an objective function that is slightly higher than Φmin at which the model is deemed to be “uncalibrated” at a certain level of confidence. Let model output read by PEST that is actually a prediction, and is hence unused by the calibration process. The range of post-calibration uncertainty of this prediction can be determined through solution of two constrained optimisation problems in which the prediction is maximised, and then minimized, subject to the constraint that the objective.\nThis means of assessing predictive uncertainty can work well where a model does not have too many parameters, and where it is numerically well-behaved so that finite-difference-based derivatives of model outputs with respect to parameters have a high degree of integrity. If these conditions are not met then other methods of predictive uncertainty assessment should be pursued; these can include linear methods, null space Monte Carlo, and PEST’s “pareto” mode.\n\n### Source\n- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation.

What PEST Does\n- **Subsection:** 3.3 Modes of Operation\n\n### Additional Summaries\n- **Higher-Level Summary:** This chapter introduces PEST, a tool for solving inverse problems in four modes: \"estimation\", \"predictive analysis\", \"regularisation\", and \"pareto\". It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.\n- **Detailed Summary:** PEST is a tool that iteratively solves inverse problems in four modes: \"estimation\", \"predictive analysis\", \"regularisation\", and \"pareto\". It uses Jacobian matrices and Marquardt lambda for parameter estimation. Different methods are employed based on problem types, with options for uncertainty analysis and parallel processing to reduce computational costs.\n\n### Related Context\n- **Previous Summary:** PEST's \"regularisation\" mode uses Tikhonov regularization (see Doherty 2015), employing measurement and regularization objective functions.  A parameter covariance matrix is not recorded; however, posterior uncertainties are investigated using utilities like PREDUNC7.\n- **Next Summary:** In \"pareto\" mode, PEST explores the trade-off between objective functions (e.g., measurement vs. regularization, or data fit vs. prediction proximity).  This allows assessment of fit quality and hypothesis testing regarding predictions (see Doherty 2015, section 8.5).  Parallel processing and SVD-assist mitigate computational costs.  Linear uncertainty analysis is possible using PEST utilities.\n\n### Metadata\n- **Keywords:** \n- **Chunk ID:** 2e473251b7f2\n- **Chunk Index:** 1\n- **Previous Chunk ID:** 2c26d6d34bff\n- **Next Chunk ID:** 753954871395\n\n---\n\n\nAnswer strictly following the above instructions.\n"
