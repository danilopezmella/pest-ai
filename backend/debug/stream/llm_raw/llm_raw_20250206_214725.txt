Question: How does the `opt_risk` setting interact with the calculation of prior parameter covariance matrices in PESTPP-OPT?
Raw Content:
The provided documentation does not contain explicit information on how the `opt_risk` setting interacts with the calculation of prior parameter covariance matrices in PESTPP-OPT. The summaries and context sections provided focus on different aspects of PEST and PEST utility support software, such as methods to increase PEST speed, reduce disk usage, and the functionality of specific matrix manipulation programs like MATQUAD. There is no mention of the `opt_risk` setting or its specific interaction with the calculation of prior parameter covariance matrices within the provided excerpts.

### Detailed Analysis:

### Follow-up Questions:
1. Question: What measures can be taken to reduce PEST's disk footprint and increase its speed for models with a large number of parameters?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Section: 15.10 Other Savings
   Available Information: "Where parameter numbers are large... Set the RSTFLE variable to “norestart”; Set JCOSAVE to “nojcosave”; Set VERBOSEREC to “noverboserec”; Set ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and IRES to 0."

2. Question: How does MATQUAD compute the quadratic form ytMy and what are the requirements for the input files?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 15.17 MATQUAD
   Available Information: "MATQUAD evaluates the quadratic form ytMy where y is a vector and M is a square matrix... requires an input vector y... MATQUAD will issue a warning message if the names of the rows of the vector y are not the same as those of the rows of M."

3. Question: What is the purpose of the MATPROD utility and what are its input requirements?
   Source: Related Context, Previous Summary
   Available Information: "MATPROD calculates the matrix product C=AB... The number of columns in matfile1 must equal the number of rows in matfile2."
