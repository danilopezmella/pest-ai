Question: What is a pest?
Raw Content:
1) Definition  
- PEST is advanced software for environmental model calibration and uncertainty analysis, designed to work with models by matching their outputs to measurements and handling the inherent non-uniqueness of model calibration through regularization. It assesses parameter and predictive uncertainty using linear and nonlinear methods, including null space Monte Carlo, and analyzes the effects of model defects on predictions.
