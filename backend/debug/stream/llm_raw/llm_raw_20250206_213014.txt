Question: What equations does PESTPP-OPT use to calculate the standard deviation of post-calibration uncertainty associated with model outputs?
Raw Content:
**Direct Answer First:**
PESTPP-OPT uses the five-point method, incorporating equations 3.5.4 and 3.5.5, to calculate the standard deviation of post-calibration uncertainty associated with model outputs. This method is preferred especially when model outputs are affected by numerical noise, which can arise from model solution convergence difficulties or other factors. The approach typically necessitates conducting four runs per parameter for each iteration to address these issues effectively.
