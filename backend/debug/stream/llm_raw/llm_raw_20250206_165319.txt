Question: What is PEST++?
Raw Content:
PEST++ refers to a suite of programs designed for parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis, management optimization, and sensitivity analysis in environmental modeling. It is an evolution of the original PEST software (Parameter ESTimation), which was released in 1995 and has been continually improved since. PEST++ programs, including the original PESTPP-GLM (initially named "PEST++"), are written in C++ and offer modular, object-oriented code that supports collaborative programming. This suite aims to replicate much of PEST's functionality while improving performance by leveraging modern programming practices.

PEST++ and PEST share a non-intrusive model interfacing approach, utilizing template and instruction files to interact with model input and output files, respectively. This allows for the running of environmental models many times, either sequentially or in parallel, to perform highly parameterized inversion. PEST++ extends PEST's capabilities by including functions such as global optimization using differential evolution, sensitivity analysis, data assimilation, and more, controlled through PEST control files and specific PEST++ control variables.

Parallelization in PEST++ follows a "manager" and "agent" concept, where model runs are distributed across various computing resources, including personal computers, high-performance computing clusters, and cloud services, using TCP/IP for communication. This modular parallel run manager is a key feature of PEST++, facilitating efficient execution of model runs in parallel.

The PEST++ suite includes programs like PESTPP-SEN for global sensitivity analysis, PESTPP-OPT for decision optimization under uncertainty, PESTPP-IES for iterative ensemble smoothing, and others, each designed for specific tasks within the broader framework of model parameter estimation and analysis. These programs manipulate model parameters, quantify mismatches between model outputs and field data, and obtain necessary information from a PEST control file, maintaining interoperability with PEST through the use of common file formats and control variables.
