Follow-up Questions:
1. Question: What are the recognized methods for global sensitivity analysis supported by PESTPP-SEN?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Section: 7.1.1 General
   Available Information: "PESTPP-SEN currently supports two GSA methods. These are the Method of Morris (Morris, 1991), with extensions proposed by Campolongo et al (2005), and the Method of Sobol (Sobol, 2001)."

2. Question: How does PESTPP-OPT handle constraints that are applied to model outputs?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Section: 8.2.4 Constraints
   Available Information: "Constraints can be applied on model outputs (read from model output files using instruction files) or on prior information equations. PESTPP-OPT allows constraints to be either “less than” or “greater than” constraints; the latter are internally reformulated as “less than” constraints..."

3. Question: What is the significance of the *opt_obj_func* variable in PESTPP-OPT's optimization process?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Section: Previous Summary
   Available Information: "*opt_obj_func* (prior information equation, file—Figure 8.1, or observation) defines PESTPP-OPT's objective function (Equation 8.4). *opt_direction* ("min" or "max") sets optimization direction."
