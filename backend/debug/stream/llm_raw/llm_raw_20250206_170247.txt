Question: What is PEST++?
Raw Content:
PEST++ is a suite of programs designed for parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis, management optimization, and sensitivity analysis in environmental modeling. It represents an evolution of the original PEST software, which stands for Parameter ESTimation and was first released in 1995. PEST++ builds upon the foundations of PEST by offering a modular, object-oriented design that supports collaborative programming and improves certain aspects of PEST's performance. The suite includes various programs, each beginning with "PESTPP" and serving different functions such as inversion, optimization, sensitivity analysis, and data assimilation. PEST++ maintains compatibility with PEST through the use of template and instruction files for non-intrusive model interfacing and a control file for defining parameters, observations, and algorithm controls. It introduces PEST++-specific control variables (denoted by "++") for additional functionalities while ensuring that these enhancements do not disrupt interoperability with PEST. The suite leverages a built-in parallel run manager for efficient execution of model runs across different computing environments, including personal computers, high-performance computing clusters, and cloud platforms. This parallelization is facilitated through a manager-agent concept using TCP/IP communication, allowing for scalable and flexible model analysis.

### Detailed Analysis:

**1) Definition/Overview**  
PEST++ is defined as a suite of programs that extend the capabilities of the original PEST software, focusing on non-intrusive, highly parameterized inversion of environmental models among other functionalities like optimization and sensitivity analysis. It uses a modular, object-oriented C++ programming approach to enhance performance and support collaborative development. The suite includes a variety of programs for different tasks, all employing template and instruction files for model interfacing and a PEST control file for parameter and observation management. It also features a built-in parallel run manager that utilizes a manager-agent concept for efficient parallel execution of model runs.
