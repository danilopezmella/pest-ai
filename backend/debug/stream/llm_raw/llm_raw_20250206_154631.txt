Question: What is pest?
Raw Content:
1) Definition  
- PEST is advanced software for environmental model calibration and uncertainty analysis, designed to handle model parameter and prediction uncertainties. It supports decision-making by identifying unlikely future events rather than predicting certain outcomes.
