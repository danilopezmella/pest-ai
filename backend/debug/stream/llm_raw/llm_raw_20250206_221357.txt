### Follow-up Questions:
1. Question: What measures can be taken to reduce disk usage and increase PEST speed for models with a large number of parameters?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Section: 15.10 Other Savings
   Available Information: "To increase PEST speed and reduce disk usage for many parameters, set RSTFLE to 'norestart', JCOSAVE to 'nojcosave', VERBOSEREC to 'noverboserec', and ICOV, ICOR, IEIG, and IRES to 0."

2. Question: How does MATQUAD compute the quadratic form ytMy?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 15.17 MATQUAD
   Available Information: "MATQUAD evaluates the quadratic form ytMy where y is a vector and M is a square matrix. It is run using the command matquad vecfile matfile matoutfile."

3. Question: What are the recommended techniques for efficient calibration of highly parameterized models using PEST?
   Source: Additional Summaries, Higher-Level Summary
   Available Information: "This chapter discusses efficient calibration methods for models with tens of thousands of parameters using PEST. Adjoint techniques are recommended for highly parameterized models."
