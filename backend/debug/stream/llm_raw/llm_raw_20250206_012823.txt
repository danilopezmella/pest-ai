Question: How does PEST perform uncertainty analysis?
Raw Content:
1) Definition  
- PEST performs uncertainty analysis by acknowledging model parameter and prediction uncertainties. It supports decisions by identifying unlikely future events rather than predicting certain outcomes. The software quantifies uncertainties and helps in decision-making by embracing real-world complexity.  
- File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Section: Summary.

2) Possible Values  
- The methods for uncertainty analysis in PEST include "predictive analysis" mode, constrained optimization considering uncertainties in model outputs (chance constraints), and other options like linear analysis, calibration-constrained Monte Carlo analysis, and Pareto functionality.  
- File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Sections: 8. Predictive Analysis, 8. PESTPP-OPT.

3) Implications  
- The choice of method for uncertainty analysis in PEST depends on the complexity of the model, the number of parameters, and the well-posedness of the inverse problem. For well-behaved models with few parameters, "predictive analysis" mode is suitable. For models with higher complexity or poorly posed inverse problems, linear analysis, Monte Carlo, or Pareto methods are recommended.

4) Practical Usage Notes  
- In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST maximizes or minimizes a prediction while keeping the objective function below a specified threshold, assessing post-calibration uncertainty. This requires accurate derivatives and a prior calibration process.  
- PESTPP-OPT solves constrained optimization problems that accommodate uncertainties in model outputs, applying chance constraints. This assumes model predictive uncertainty stems from model parameter uncertainty, which in turn comes from prior parameter uncertainty and the calibration process.

Follow-up Questions:

1. How does the "predictive analysis" mode specifically assess post-calibration uncertainty, and what are the theoretical bases for this mode as described in Doherty (2015)?
2. What are the specific challenges and considerations in using PESTPP-OPT for solving constrained optimization problems with chance constraints?
3. How does PEST handle the calibration process to minimize error variance and ensure model outputs are near the center of their posterior distributions?
4. In what ways can the integrity of finite-difference derivatives affect the performance of PEST in "predictive analysis" mode?
5. What are the advantages and limitations of using linear analysis, calibration-constrained Monte Carlo analysis, and Pareto functionality in PEST for uncertainty analysis compared to "predictive analysis" mode?
