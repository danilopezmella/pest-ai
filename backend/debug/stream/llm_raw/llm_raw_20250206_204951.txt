Question: How does PEST manage the calculation of derivatives for grouped parameters?
Raw Content:
PEST manages the calculation of derivatives for grouped parameters by assigning parameters to groups within the PEST control file. This approach is fundamental for the calculation of partial derivatives of all observations with respect to all adjustable parameters, which are essential for the inversion methodologies supported by PEST. These derivatives are stored in the Jacobian matrix. Since PEST operates independently of any specific model, it cannot calculate these derivatives using model-specific formulae. Instead, PEST evaluates the derivatives using model outputs calculated based on incrementally varied parameter values. However, if a model can calculate its own derivatives with respect to its adjustable parameters, PEST can directly use these provided derivatives if they are in the correct format.

The accuracy of these derivative calculations is crucial for PEST's performance. Poor numerical integrity of the partial derivatives in the Jacobian matrix, caused by round-off errors or poor model numerical performance, can hinder PEST from solving an inverse problem. To manage the complexity and memory usage, PEST assigns the input variables, which govern the finite-difference derivatives calculation, to parameter groups rather than to individual parameters. This grouping also reflects the natural categorization of parameters in many models, such as pilot-point parameters describing system properties of the same type. However, PEST allows for individual parameter treatment in terms of derivative calculation by assigning each parameter to its own group if desired.

### Detailed Analysis:

**1) Definition/Overview**
PEST calculates partial derivatives of observations with respect to adjustable parameters, storing these as elements of the Jacobian matrix. This process is crucial for the inversion methodologies PEST supports. Derivatives are calculated using finite differences or directly used from model-provided values. Parameters are grouped to manage derivative calculations efficiently, with the option for individual parameter treatment.

**2) Possible Values**
Not applicable for this topic.

**3) Implications**
The accuracy of derivative calculations directly impacts PEST's ability to solve inverse problems. Poor numerical integrity due to round-off errors or model numerical issues can prevent PEST from functioning effectively. Grouping parameters for derivative calculations introduces savings in memory and complexity, while individual treatment allows for precise control over the derivative calculation process.

**4) Practical Usage Notes**
Parameters must be assigned to groups within the PEST control file for derivative calculation management. This assignment reduces the complexity of the PEST input dataset and allows for natural categorization of parameters. Individual treatment of parameters regarding derivative calculations is possible by assigning each parameter to its own group.
