Question: How does PEST perform model calibration?
Raw Content:
1) Definition  
- PEST performs model calibration by parallelizing model runs to reduce overall run time. It uses Parallel PEST and BEOPEST to distribute model runs across available machines, with BEOPEST utilizing faster TCP/IP communication for efficiency. Model calibration involves adjusting model parameters to minimize the difference between model predictions and observed data, aiming for a target objective function value that approximates the number of non-zero-weighted observations.

2) Possible Values  
- For model calibration, PEST can use either standard deviations of measurement noise or weights equal to the inverse standard deviations of measurement noise. The calibration process is considered successful when the objective function is reduced to a value about equal to the number of non-zero-weighted observations.

3) Implications  
- Using standard deviations of measurement noise or weights equal to their inverse standard deviations impacts the calibration process by guiding PEST towards an objective function value that reflects the accuracy of the model in representing observed data. A suitable objective function value indicates a good fit between model predictions and observations, which can be further analyzed for predictive uncertainty using posterior prediction histograms.

4) Practical Usage Notes  
- To perform model calibration with PEST, first verify the PEST control file using PESTCHEK. Run PESTPP-IES with the command `pestpp-ies case` or `pestpp-ies case_sd`, depending on whether standard deviations are provided. Monitor the objective function value in `case.phi.actual.csv` and accept results when the target objective function value is achieved. Use `case.J.obs.csv` for creating posterior prediction histograms.
