### Follow-up Questions:

1. Question: What are the recommended adjoint techniques for highly parameterized models?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Higher-Level Summary
   Available Information: "Adjoint techniques are recommended for highly parameterized models."

2. Question: How does MATQUAD compute the scalar result of y^TMy?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 15.17 MATQUAD
   Available Information: "MATQUAD computes y^TMy (from vecfile and matfile, section 2.4), outputting the scalar result as a 1x1 matrix to matoutfile and displaying it on the screen."

3. Question: What is the significance of setting RSTFLE to "norestart" in PEST?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Section: 15.10 Other Savings
   Available Information: "Set the RSTFLE variable to 'norestart';"
