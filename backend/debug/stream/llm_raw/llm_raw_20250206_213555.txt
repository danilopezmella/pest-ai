### Follow-up Questions:
1. Question: What are the default settings for optimization in PESTPP-OPT?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Main Section: 8. PESTPP-OPT, Subsection: 8.2 Using PESTPP-OPT
   Available Information: "Constraints can be applied on model outputs... At least one model output constraint is required; otherwise, PESTPP-OPT halts."

2. Question: How does PESTPP-OPT treat weights assigned to model output constraints?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Main Section: 8. PESTPP-OPT, Subsection: 8.2 Using PESTPP-OPT
   Available Information: "It is important to note that weights assigned in the PEST control file to model outputs to which constraints are applied have no bearing on their operation, unless they are set to zero."

3. Question: What methods does PESTPP-SEN support for global sensitivity analysis?
   Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Main Section: 7. PESTPP-SEN, Subsection: 7.1 Introduction
   Available Information: "PESTPP-SEN currently supports two GSA methods... the Method of Morris... and the Method of Sobol."
