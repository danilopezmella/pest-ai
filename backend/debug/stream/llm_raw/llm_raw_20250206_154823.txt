Question: What is a pest?
Raw Content:
PEST (Parameter ESTimation) is an advanced, model-independent software suite designed for environmental model calibration and uncertainty analysis. It facilitates the calibration of models by adjusting model parameters to match model outputs with observed data. The uniqueness of PEST lies in its ability to operate in a non-intrusive manner, interacting with models through their input and output files, thus eliminating the need for programming to calibrate a model. PEST is part of a broader suite that includes tools for post-calibration uncertainty analysis, supporting decision-making by identifying unlikely future events rather than predicting certain outcomes with absolute certainty. This suite acknowledges the inherent uncertainties in model parameters and predictions, embracing the complexity of environmental systems. It employs various methodologies, including regularization to handle the non-uniqueness of model calibration, and linear and nonlinear methods for assessing parameter and predictive uncertainty. The suite also includes utilities for sensitivity analysis, optimization, and the exploration of model defects' effects on predictions. The theoretical foundation for PEST and its utility support software is detailed in Doherty (2015), which discusses the theory and practice of model calibration and uncertainty analysis extensively.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1) **Definition/Overview**
   - PEST stands for "parameter estimation" and is a software suite used for the calibration of environmental models by adjusting model parameters to match outputs with observed data. It operates in a model-independent manner, requiring no programming to calibrate a model, as it interacts with models through their input and output files. PEST is part of a suite that includes tools for uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis, optimization, and the exploration of model defects. It supports decision-making by identifying unlikely future events, acknowledging the uncertainties in model parameters and predictions.

2) **Possible Values**
   - Not applicable for this topic.

3) **Implications**
   - Using PEST for model calibration involves acknowledging and addressing the non-uniqueness of solutions and the uncertainties in model parameters and predictions. Regularization is employed to manage non-uniqueness, and various linear and nonlinear methods are used for uncertainty analysis. The suite's non-intrusive nature facilitates its application across different environmental models, promoting a comprehensive understanding of model complexities and uncertainties in environmental decision-making processes.
