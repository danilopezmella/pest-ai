**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does PEST handle the non-uniqueness inherent in model calibration processes?
2. What methodologies does PEST provide for the exploration of pre- and post-calibration parameter uncertainty?
3. Can you detail the process and benefits of using 64-bit versions of PEST for large problem sizes?
4. What are the specific operational details of PEST in solving inverse problems, as mentioned in the general overview section?
5. How does PEST's approach to parameter estimation differ from other software, and what makes it model-independent?
