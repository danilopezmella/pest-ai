Question: How does PEST perform model calibration?
Raw Content:
1) Definition  
- PEST performs model calibration by parallelizing model runs to reduce run time, using Parallel PEST and BEOPEST for efficient computation. It involves distributing model runs across available machines, with BEOPEST utilizing faster TCP/IP communication for minimal overheads. Calibration is further refined using PESTPP-IES, which adjusts based on the provided standard deviations of measurement noise or weights, aiming to minimize the objective function to a target value.

- File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 18.3.7 Running PESTPP-IES

2) Possible Values  
- For BEOPEST: Utilization of TCP/IP for messaging and local file I/O by agents.  
- For PESTPP-IES: Decision to run with `case` or `case_sd` based on the provision of standard deviations, and the choice of accepting calibration results at a specific iteration based on the objective function value.

- File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 18.3.7 Running PESTPP-IES

3) Implications  
- The efficiency of Parallel PEST decreases with short model run times due to overheads, while BEOPEST minimizes these by performing file I/O locally.  
- The calibration outcome using PESTPP-IES depends on the correct provision of measurement noise standard deviations or weights, aiming to achieve an objective function value near the number of non-zero-weighted observations. Incorrect settings can lead to suboptimal calibration.

4) Practical Usage Notes  
- For BEOPEST: It's highlighted that manager/agent communication overheads are very low, making it efficient for parallel processing.  
- For PESTPP-IES: Monitoring of `case.phi.actual.csv` is recommended to determine the iteration number at which the desired objective function value is achieved, with a possibility to accept results from a few iterations before the last.
