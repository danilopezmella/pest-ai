Question: How do PESTPP-GLM and PESTPP-OPT handle poor numerical integrity of finite-difference derivatives?
Raw Content:
**Direct Answer First:**
PESTPP-GLM and PESTPP-OPT address the issue of poor numerical integrity of finite-difference derivatives through several strategies. Firstly, they provide utility programs such as JACTEST, POSTJACTEST, and MULJCOSEN to assess the integrity of finite-difference derivatives. Secondly, PESTPP-GLM uses a control variable `der_forgive()` to manage model failures during derivative calculations; if set to `true` (the default), it freezes the parameter at its current value upon failure, whereas if set to `false`, it halts execution. Additionally, an algorithm is implemented to iteratively remove parameters with maximum composite sensitivity from the parameter upgrade calculations if the objective function does not improve, which helps mitigate the impact of corrupted Jacobian matrix elements on parameter upgrades.

1. **Detailed Analysis:**

   **1) Definition/Overview**
   - Poor numerical integrity of finite-difference derivatives in PESTPP-GLM and PESTPP-OPT can significantly affect performance. The documentation outlines methods to diagnose and address these issues, including utility programs for assessing derivative integrity and strategies for handling model run failures during the derivative calculation phase.

   **2) Possible Values**
   - The `der_forgive()` control variable can be set to either `true` or `false`, with `true` being the default. This variable determines the behavior of PESTPP-GLM in response to model run failures during derivative calculations.

   **3) Implications**
   - Setting `der_forgive()` to `true` allows PESTPP-GLM to continue execution by freezing parameters at their current values upon model run failures during derivative calculations. Setting it to `false` results in halting execution, which may be preferable in cases where continuing could lead to misleading results.
   - The iterative removal of parameters with maximum composite sensitivity is a strategy to improve the objective function or acknowledge when further removal is unproductive, differentiating from automatic user intervention by the order of sensitivity considered.

   **4) Practical Usage Notes**
   - To diagnose issues with finite-difference derivatives, users are advised to utilize JACTEST, POSTJACTEST, and MULJCOSEN utility programs. These tools help in assessing the integrity of derivatives and identifying potential problems.
   - The choice between setting `der_forgive()` to `true` or `false` should be based on the user's tolerance for model run failures during the derivative calculation phase and the impact of such failures on the overall parameter estimation process.
   - The algorithm for removing parameters with maximum composite sensitivity should be employed when corrupted Jacobian matrix elements are suspected to hinder parameter upgrades.

      Question: How does the `der_forgive()` control variable affect the behavior of PESTPP-GLM during model run failures in derivative calculations?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Section: 6.2.9 Model Run Failure
      Available Information: "The *der_forgive()* control variable can be used to govern PESTPPâ€™s behavior under these circumstances. It must be supplied as either *true* or *false*. If it is supplied as *true* (its default value) then model run failure when finite difference derivatives are being calculated is accommodated using the first of the above alternatives, that is through temporary freezing of the parameter at its current value."

      Available Information: "An algorithm iteratively removes parameters with maximum composite sensitivity until the objective function improves or further removal is unproductive; it differs from AUI by removing parameters in decreasing sensitivity order."
