Question: What are the implications of using a risk-averse setting (>0.5) on the optimization outcome in PESTPP-OPT?
Raw Content:
Direct Answer First:
The provided documentation does not explicitly address the implications of using a risk-averse setting (>0.5) on the optimization outcome in PESTPP-OPT. The documentation focuses on the definition and application of constraints within PESTPP-OPT, the performance issues related to bad numerical derivatives, the principles of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) in PESTPP-SEN, the concept of local optima in nonlinear inverse problems, and the approach to handling insensitive parameters in unregularized inversions. It discusses the use of observation groups to define constraints, the importance of derivative integrity, the methods and purposes of GSA, the distinction between local optima and parameter nonuniqueness, and strategies for dealing with insensitive parameters. However, it does not provide specific information on how a risk-averse setting greater than 0.5 influences the optimization results in PESTPP-OPT.

      Question: What are the methods supported by PESTPP-SEN for global sensitivity analysis?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Section: 7.1.1 General
      Available Information: "PESTPP-SEN currently supports two GSA methods. These are the Method of Morris (Morris, 1991), with extensions proposed by Campolongo et al (2005), and the Method of Sobol (Sobol, 2001)."

      Question: How does PESTPP-OPT identify and apply constraints on model outputs?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis, Section: 8.2.4 Constraints
      Available Information: "Constraints can be applied on model outputs... Constraints are identified using observation groups... you can also nominate groups which contain constraints using the *opt_constraint_groups()* control variable."

      Question: What is the impact of poor model algorithm on local optima according to PEST documentation?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers, Section: 1.6.5 Local Optima
      Available Information: "Furthermore, as Kavetski et al (2006) point out, sometimes local optima arise as an unwanted outcome of a poor model algorithm."
