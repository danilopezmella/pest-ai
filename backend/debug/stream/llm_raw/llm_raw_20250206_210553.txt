2. **Follow-up Questions:**
   1. Question: What is the purpose of the WTSENOUT utility in PEST?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 5.21 WTSENOUT
      Available Information: "WTSENOUT" stands for “weighted sensitivity and model outputs”. It undertakes tasks such as reading PEST control, JCO, and RES files, calculating Q1/2J and Q1/2o, and writing these to files.

   2. Question: How does CALMAINTAIN attempt to maintain model calibration after parameter changes?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 14.3 CALMAINTAIN
      Available Information: CALMAINTAIN compensates for changes in a subset of parameters by adjusting another subset, aiming to maintain calibration. It solves equation 14.3.3 exactly if possible, otherwise minimizes the right side of Equation 14.3.4.

   3. Question: What are the requirements for running WTSENOUT according to the PEST control file settings?
      Source: File: PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual Part II: PEST Utility Support Software, Section: 5.21 WTSENOUT
      Available Information: WTSENOUT requires the PEST control file to be set to "estimation" mode. It will cease execution with an error message if not in this mode.
