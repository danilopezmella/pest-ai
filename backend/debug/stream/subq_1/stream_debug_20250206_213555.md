### Summary
**PESTPP-OPT uses observation groups ("l_" or "less_" for ≤ constraints, "g_" or "greater_" for ≥ constraints) to define constraints on model outputs/prior information.  The *opt_constraint_groups* variable (comma-separated list) can override this. Zero weights disable constraints;  positive weights (if *opt_std_weights(true)*) are treated as standard deviations. At least one model output constraint is required; otherwise, PESTPP-OPT halts.**

### Header
**8.2.4 Constraints**

### Content
Constraints can be applied on model outputs (read from model output files using instruction files) or on prior information equations. PESTPP-OPT allows constraints to be either “less than” or “greater than” constraints; the latter are internally reformulated as “less than” constraints to meet the demands of the linear programming algorithm that it implements. Constraints are identified using observation groups. If an observation group contains “less than” constraints, then its name must begin with “l\_” (that is, the letter “el” followed by an underscore) or “less\_”; if an observation group contains “greater than” constraints then its name must begin with “g\_” or “greater\_”. Do not forget that prior information equations are also assigned to observation groups.
While the naming of observation groups in this way is sufficient to denote them as containing constraints, you can also nominate groups which contain constraints using the *opt_constraint_groups()* control variable. The value of this control variable is a comma-delimited set of observation groups. The name of each such group must begin with “l\_” or “g\_” (or “less\_” or “greater\_”) in accordance with the protocol described above so that PESTPP-OPT knows what type of constraints they are. If an *opt_constraint_groups()* keyword is supplied, and if a group name that begins with “l\_” or “g\_” (or “less\_” or “greater”) is omitted from the list of groups supplied through this variable, then members of that group do not comprise optimization constraints. They are therefore observations which comprise part of the calibration dataset (unless the pertinent observations are assigned weights of zero in the PEST control file).
It is important to note that weights assigned in the PEST control file to model outputs to which constraints are applied have no bearing on their operation, unless they are set to zero. If the weight associated with a constraint is set to zero, then the constraint is disabled. However, if the weight is positive, its value does not affect the strength with which the constraint is applied, with one exception: if the *opt_std_weights()* option is used, then the weight values for the non-zero weight constraints are treated as standard deviations (uncertainty) for use in the chance constraint process. This option can help speed up the repeated application of PESTPP-OPT by allowing users to pre-calculate constraint uncertainty through application of PREDUNC, pyEMU or through empirical constraint uncertainty estimation via ensembles. In this way, PESTPP-OPT does not need to solve any linear analysis equations and instead simply uses these standard deviations directly.
In the simplex algorithm, all constraints are “hard”. It is the nature of most constrained optimization problems that the solution to that problem lies at a “corner” of decision variable space that is defined by the intersection of constraint surfaces. In that corner, at least one constraint specification is exactly met.
In addition to constraints applied to model outputs and prior information equations, the upper and lower bounds on decision variables supplied in the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file comprise a further set of constraints which are respected by the constrained optimization process that is implemented by PESTPP-OPT. Obviously, these are applied to each decision variable individually.
As presently programmed, PESTPP-OPT requires that at least one constraint be applied to a model output. Hence if the only constraints that are specified in a PEST control file that is read by PESTPP-OPT are those on individual decision variables through their bounds, and/or on prior information equations that feature those decision variables, PESTPP-OPT will cease execution with an appropriate message.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST optimizes predictions while maintaining the objective function below a threshold, considering post-calibration uncertainty. It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction (in the "predict" group) while keeping the objective function ≤ Φ0 (requires a prior "estimation" run).  It uses the same parameters, transformations, and observations as the estimation run.  Restarting uses `/r`, `/j`, `/d`, or `/s` (parallel runs).  Change limits remain important.  Screen output shows prediction values per iteration.  Results include the optimal prediction and parameter values.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** *opt_obj_func* (prior information equation, file—Figure 8.1, or observation) defines PESTPP-OPT's objective function (Equation 8.4). *opt_direction* ("min" or "max") sets optimization direction.  If *opt_obj_func* is absent, coefficients default to 1.0.  The file must list all decision variables and their coefficients (space, tab, or comma-delimited; comment lines are ignored).
- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-OPT uses observations (excluding zero-weighted ones) and sensitivities (from the JCO file) for notional calibration (Equations 8.1-8.3), calculating posterior parameter uncertainties. Weights are inversely proportional to measurement noise standard deviations (PWTADJ2 can adjust weights); the objective function should approximate the number of non-zero-weighted observations.  Prior information equations are ignored unless they contain decision variables.  Zero weights omit observations from calibration;  a user-supplied posterior covariance matrix can replace the prior one.

### Content
If PESTPP-GLM or PESTPP-OPT does not perform as well as you think it should, then bad numerical derivatives may be the cause of the problem. The PEST suite includes a number of utility programs which allow you to explore the integrity of finite-difference derivatives.

- **Detailed Summary:** PEST is a tool that iteratively solves inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses Jacobian matrices and Marquardt lambda for parameter estimation. Different methods are employed based on problem types, with options for uncertainty analysis and parallel processing to reduce computational costs.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Maximize model output precision (especially for PESTPP-GLM/PESTPP-OPT) by adjusting model control variables to prioritize precision over speed. Tighten solver convergence criteria but avoid excessively long runtimes. Larger parameter increments and three-point derivative methods (parabolic or best-fit) can mitigate granular outputs from adaptive time-stepping or model algorithms.  Precise inter-submodel data transfer is also crucial for composite models.
- **Next Summary:** PEST and PEST++ programs store Jacobian matrices (sensitivities of model outputs to parameters) in binary JCO files (case.jco).  Columns represent parameters; rows represent observations. Log-transformed parameters use log-based derivatives. Utilities (JACWRIT, JCO2MAT, JROW2VEC, JCO2JCO, and PyEMU) provide ASCII conversion, manipulation, and subsetting. JCO files are used for sensitivity analysis, calibration (using the `/i` switch in PEST or *base_jacobian()* in PESTPP-GLM), and linear analyses (identifiability, uncertainty, data worth, model defects).  NOPTMAX=-1 or -2 generates JCO files only.

### Summary
**PESTPP-SEN performs global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using Morris' (Morris 1991, Campolongo et al 2005) or Sobol's (Sobol 2001) methods (Saltelli et al 2004, 2008). Morris' method (efficient for slow models) provides mean and variance of parameter effects; Sobol's method (computationally expensive) reveals parameter nonlinearity and interactions.  GSA helps simplify models, identify important parameters, and improve intuition.  If all observation weights are zero, PESTPP-SEN resets them to 1.0 before calculating phi and group phi sensitivities.**

### Header
**7.1.1 General**

### Content
The purpose of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is to characterize how model parameters affect model outputs (or a function of model outputs such as an objective function) over a wide range of acceptable parameter values. In doing this, it strives for greater robustness, and for the provision of more information, than local sensitivity analysis based on partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. Because local sensitivity analysis pertains to a single point in parameter space, the information that it yields is often insufficient to support an understanding of the behavior of nonlinear models whose outputs depend on combinations of model parameters in complicated and parameter-value-dependent ways.
The information provided by global sensitivity analysis differs widely between the different methodologies that implement it. In general, the more information that a global sensitivity analysis method provides, the greater is its computational burden. This information can vary from a simple measure of the influence that each parameter has on selected model outputs, to a complete description of how a parameter’s influence varies with its value, and the values of other model parameters. See Saltelli et al (2004; 2008) for an excellent coverage of these methods.
Global sensitivity analysis can support environmental modeling in at least the following ways.
1.  Once it is recognized that some parameters affect model outputs to only a limited extent, these parameters can be fixed at user-specified values while others are estimated through calibration. This can accrue considerable numerical savings in the calibration of models whose run times are long.
2.  Global sensitivity analysis may support construction of a simple model in place of a more complex one for use in calibration, uncertainty analysis and decision support.
3.  By establishing the parameters that are important, and the interactions between parameters that are important, much can be learned about the system which a model attempts to simulate. This information can sharpen the intuition of those who must manage that system.
PESTPP-SEN currently supports two GSA methods. These are
1.  the Method of Morris (Morris, 1991), with extensions proposed by Campolongo et al (2005), and
2.  the Method of Sobol (Sobol, 2001).
The Method of Morris is a “one-at-a-time” method (Saltelli et al, 2004). It is computationally efficient and is therefore suitable for use with models whose run times are high. It provides estimates of the first two moments (mean and variance) of the effect that each parameter has on a model output of interest. These statistics acknowledge that a parameter’s sensitivity may be a function not just of its own value, but of the values of other parameters. In doing so, they reveal those parameters that have the most influence on model outputs of interest, and the consistency of these influences over parameter space. The information that it provides may justify the omission of some parameters from a calibration exercise; and/or it may support the design of a simple, fast-running, surrogate model. In contrast, the Method of Sobol has the potential to provide much more detailed information than the Method of Morris. Because it is based on decomposition of variance (Saltelli et al, 2004), it can reveal details of parameter nonlinearity that are beyond the reach of other methods. It can also reveal complex parameter interactions and, by inference, interaction of the processes to which these parameters pertain. Unfortunately, this information comes with a high computational cost. Hence unless Sobol-based global sensitivity analysis is restricted to only a few parameters and a relatively fast-running model, it is generally computationally unaffordable.
IMPORTANT: Note that PESTPP-SEN records phi and group phi sensitivity metrics and these phi metrics rely on the weights in the \* observation data section of the control file. As such, if all observations have zero weight, then the phi and group phi summary metrics will be zero. PESTPP-SEN tries to counter this problem by resetting all weights to 1.0 if all weights are zero. Otherwise, it is up to users to make sure the weights are appropriate for summarizing phi sensitivities.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** PEST's sensitivity reuse feature in Chapter 7 reduces model runs by skipping low-sensitivity parameter recalculations, but is cautioned against for nonlinear problems. SVD-assist is a preferable alternative, with sensitivities recomputed every N iterations. Broyden updating remains active. DOSENREUSE in "control data" toggles this feature, with SENRELTHRESH, SENMAXREUSE, SENALLCALCINT, SENPREDWEIGHT, and SENPIEXCLUDE offering customization options.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST's sensitivity reuse functionality (Chapter 7) reduces model runs by skipping recalculation of low-sensitivity parameters, but is not generally recommended, especially for nonlinear problems;  SVD-assist offers a better alternative. Sensitivities are recomputed every N iterations (user-defined).  Broyden updating still occurs regardless of the setting.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Table 6.3 shows optional PESTPP-GLM control variables (with defaults):  `der_forgive()`, `enforce_tied_bounds()`, `glm_accept_mc_phi()`, `rand_seed()`, `glm_rebase_super()`, `glm_iter_mc()`, `ensemble_output_precision()`, and `glm_norm_form()`.  These control derivative handling, bound enforcement, Monte Carlo acceptance, random seed, super parameter re-basing, iterative Monte Carlo, ensemble output precision, and normal matrix form.  Parallel run management variables (section 5.3.6) can also be used.
- **Next Summary:** To analyze parameter group sensitivities, tie all but one group member to the remaining parameter (the parent).  Alternatively, use the *tie_by_group()* control variable.  Ensure tied parameter values are realistic;  tied parameters' bounds are calculated at the start (reported to the run record file) to maintain bounds.  Global sensitivity analysis assesses joint sensitivity.

### Summary
**The five-point method with α and β from equations 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 is preferred when model outputs contain numerical noise from convergence difficulties or other factors.  This often motivates using four runs per parameter per iteration.**

### Header
**3.5.2 Forward, Central and Five-Point Differences**

### Content
The latter choice is far better where model outputs are contaminated by numerical noise that may arise from model solution convergence difficulties and other factors. It would normally be to address this problem that a modeller would even consider undertaking four runs per parameter per iteration.

It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST calculates Jacobian matrix elements using finite differences unless provided by the model. Accurate derivatives are crucial, managed by SVD or LSQR for ill-posedness. Parameters are grouped for derivative calculation management. PEST offers forward, central, and five-point finite-difference methods, with central methods providing higher accuracy. Model-calculated derivatives are preferred for accuracy and speed.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PEST calculates derivatives using forward (one model run per parameter), central (two runs), or five-point (four runs) finite-difference methods. Central methods (outside points, parabolic, least-squares) offer higher accuracy than forward differences. Five-point methods use equation 3.5.1, with α and β from equations 3.5.2-3.5.5 for precision or minimum error variance.
- **Next Summary:** PEST offers "absolute," "relative," and "rel_to_max" parameter increment types (INCTYP, DERINC).  "Relative" and "rel_to_max" adjust increments based on parameter values; DERINCLB provides a minimum increment.  Increments must allow distinguishing incremented and non-incremented parameter values in the model input file.  Increments cannot exceed the parameter range divided by 3.2.

### Summary
**Regularization best addresses problems caused by insensitive parameters in unregularized inversions. Alternatively, temporarily holding troublesome parameters (identified via the parameter sensitivity file) at their current values, may allow the objective function to improve.  This process may need to be repeated for multiple parameters.**

### Header
**6.2.2 Fixing the Problem**

### Content
As stated above, this problem is most easily fixed by introducing regularisation to the inverse problem. Another (older and no longer recommended) solution to this problem is to hold parameters which are identified as being troublesome at their current values, at least for a while. With such recalcitrant parameters “out of the road”, PEST can often achieve a significant improvement in the objective function. Such temporarily held parameters can then be brought back into the parameter estimation process at a later date.
It may be found that quite a few parameters need to be held in this manner, for once a particular troublesome parameter has been identified and held, it may be found that the problem does not go away because another insensitive parameter then dominates the parameter upgrade vector. When that parameter is held, yet another troublesome parameter may be identified, and so on. All such parameters can be temporarily held at their current values if desired. A user may hold such parameters one by one as they are identified in the manner described above, or he/she may prefer instead to take the pre-emptive measure of temporarily holding at their current values all parameters identified in the parameter sensitivity file as being particularly insensitive, and hence potentially troublesome.

- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers
- **Main Section:** 6. Intervention
- **Subsection:** 6.2 User Intervention

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Chapter 6 discusses automatic user intervention in PEST for regularization methods in parameter estimation. It suggests identifying and temporarily fixing insensitive parameters to improve matrix condition number and objective function. Parameters like DOAUI and MAXAUI customize intervention behavior, with options for mitigating bad derivatives and improving sensitivity.
- **Detailed Summary:** In unregularized inversions, insensitive parameters can lead to large adjustments beyond set limits, resulting in minimal objective function improvement. Increasing limits may not help; regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity is recommended. Use the parameter sensitivity file to identify insensitive parameters and consider temporarily holding them at current values using the case.hld file.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** In unregularized, highly parameterized inversions, insensitive parameters may cause large adjustments exceeding change limits (RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, ABSPARMAX(N)), resulting in minimal objective function reduction. Increasing these limits may not solve the problem; instead, consider regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity.  The parameter sensitivity file (section 5.3.3) helps identify insensitive parameters.
- **Next Summary:** A case.hld file (Figure 6.1) allows modifying RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, LAMBDA, UPVECBEND, and "predictive analysis" variables.  It can temporarily hold parameters ("hold parameter"), parameter groups ("hold group"), or eigenvectors ("hold eigenvector") at their current values.  Ignored lines include comments (#) and incorrect entries.  The file must be deleted after use.

### Summary
**PESTPP-OPT uses observation groups ("l_" or "less_" for ≤ constraints, "g_" or "greater_" for ≥ constraints) to define constraints on model outputs/prior information.  The *opt_constraint_groups* variable (comma-separated list) can override this. Zero weights disable constraints;  positive weights (if *opt_std_weights(true)*) are treated as standard deviations. At least one model output constraint is required; otherwise, PESTPP-OPT halts.**

### Header
**8.2.4 Constraints**

### Content
Constraints can be applied on model outputs (read from model output files using instruction files) or on prior information equations. PESTPP-OPT allows constraints to be either “less than” or “greater than” constraints; the latter are internally reformulated as “less than” constraints to meet the demands of the linear programming algorithm that it implements. Constraints are identified using observation groups. If an observation group contains “less than” constraints, then its name must begin with “l\_” (that is, the letter “el” followed by an underscore) or “less\_”; if an observation group contains “greater than” constraints then its name must begin with “g\_” or “greater\_”. Do not forget that prior information equations are also assigned to observation groups.
While the naming of observation groups in this way is sufficient to denote them as containing constraints, you can also nominate groups which contain constraints using the *opt_constraint_groups()* control variable. The value of this control variable is a comma-delimited set of observation groups. The name of each such group must begin with “l\_” or “g\_” (or “less\_” or “greater\_”) in accordance with the protocol described above so that PESTPP-OPT knows what type of constraints they are. If an *opt_constraint_groups()* keyword is supplied, and if a group name that begins with “l\_” or “g\_” (or “less\_” or “greater”) is omitted from the list of groups supplied through this variable, then members of that group do not comprise optimization constraints. They are therefore observations which comprise part of the calibration dataset (unless the pertinent observations are assigned weights of zero in the PEST control file).
It is important to note that weights assigned in the PEST control file to model outputs to which constraints are applied have no bearing on their operation, unless they are set to zero. If the weight associated with a constraint is set to zero, then the constraint is disabled. However, if the weight is positive, its value does not affect the strength with which the constraint is applied, with one exception: if the *opt_std_weights()* option is used, then the weight values for the non-zero weight constraints are treated as standard deviations (uncertainty) for use in the chance constraint process. This option can help speed up the repeated application of PESTPP-OPT by allowing users to pre-calculate constraint uncertainty through application of PREDUNC, pyEMU or through empirical constraint uncertainty estimation via ensembles. In this way, PESTPP-OPT does not need to solve any linear analysis equations and instead simply uses these standard deviations directly.
In the simplex algorithm, all constraints are “hard”. It is the nature of most constrained optimization problems that the solution to that problem lies at a “corner” of decision variable space that is defined by the intersection of constraint surfaces. In that corner, at least one constraint specification is exactly met.
In addition to constraints applied to model outputs and prior information equations, the upper and lower bounds on decision variables supplied in the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file comprise a further set of constraints which are respected by the constrained optimization process that is implemented by PESTPP-OPT. Obviously, these are applied to each decision variable individually.
As presently programmed, PESTPP-OPT requires that at least one constraint be applied to a model output. Hence if the only constraints that are specified in a PEST control file that is read by PESTPP-OPT are those on individual decision variables through their bounds, and/or on prior information equations that feature those decision variables, PESTPP-OPT will cease execution with an appropriate message.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST optimizes predictions while maintaining the objective function below a threshold, considering post-calibration uncertainty. It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** In "predictive analysis" mode, PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction (in the "predict" group) while keeping the objective function ≤ Φ0 (requires a prior "estimation" run).  It uses the same parameters, transformations, and observations as the estimation run.  Restarting uses `/r`, `/j`, `/d`, or `/s` (parallel runs).  Change limits remain important.  Screen output shows prediction values per iteration.  Results include the optimal prediction and parameter values.

- **Previous Summary:** *opt_obj_func* (prior information equation, file—Figure 8.1, or observation) defines PESTPP-OPT's objective function (Equation 8.4). *opt_direction* ("min" or "max") sets optimization direction.  If *opt_obj_func* is absent, coefficients default to 1.0.  The file must list all decision variables and their coefficients (space, tab, or comma-delimited; comment lines are ignored).
- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-OPT uses observations (excluding zero-weighted ones) and sensitivities (from the JCO file) for notional calibration (Equations 8.1-8.3), calculating posterior parameter uncertainties. Weights are inversely proportional to measurement noise standard deviations (PWTADJ2 can adjust weights); the objective function should approximate the number of non-zero-weighted observations.  Prior information equations are ignored unless they contain decision variables.  Zero weights omit observations from calibration;  a user-supplied posterior covariance matrix can replace the prior one.

- **Detailed Summary:** PEST is a tool that iteratively solves inverse problems in four modes: "estimation", "predictive analysis", "regularisation", and "pareto". It uses Jacobian matrices and Marquardt lambda for parameter estimation. Different methods are employed based on problem types, with options for uncertainty analysis and parallel processing to reduce computational costs.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** Maximize model output precision (especially for PESTPP-GLM/PESTPP-OPT) by adjusting model control variables to prioritize precision over speed. Tighten solver convergence criteria but avoid excessively long runtimes. Larger parameter increments and three-point derivative methods (parabolic or best-fit) can mitigate granular outputs from adaptive time-stepping or model algorithms.  Precise inter-submodel data transfer is also crucial for composite models.
- **Next Summary:** PEST and PEST++ programs store Jacobian matrices (sensitivities of model outputs to parameters) in binary JCO files (case.jco).  Columns represent parameters; rows represent observations. Log-transformed parameters use log-based derivatives. Utilities (JACWRIT, JCO2MAT, JROW2VEC, JCO2JCO, and PyEMU) provide ASCII conversion, manipulation, and subsetting. JCO files are used for sensitivity analysis, calibration (using the `/i` switch in PEST or *base_jacobian()* in PESTPP-GLM), and linear analyses (identifiability, uncertainty, data worth, model defects).  NOPTMAX=-1 or -2 generates JCO files only.

### Summary
**PESTPP-SEN performs global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using Morris' (Morris 1991, Campolongo et al 2005) or Sobol's (Sobol 2001) methods (Saltelli et al 2004, 2008). Morris' method (efficient for slow models) provides mean and variance of parameter effects; Sobol's method (computationally expensive) reveals parameter nonlinearity and interactions.  GSA helps simplify models, identify important parameters, and improve intuition.  If all observation weights are zero, PESTPP-SEN resets them to 1.0 before calculating phi and group phi sensitivities.**

### Header
**7.1.1 General**

### Content
The purpose of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is to characterize how model parameters affect model outputs (or a function of model outputs such as an objective function) over a wide range of acceptable parameter values. In doing this, it strives for greater robustness, and for the provision of more information, than local sensitivity analysis based on partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. Because local sensitivity analysis pertains to a single point in parameter space, the information that it yields is often insufficient to support an understanding of the behavior of nonlinear models whose outputs depend on combinations of model parameters in complicated and parameter-value-dependent ways.
The information provided by global sensitivity analysis differs widely between the different methodologies that implement it. In general, the more information that a global sensitivity analysis method provides, the greater is its computational burden. This information can vary from a simple measure of the influence that each parameter has on selected model outputs, to a complete description of how a parameter’s influence varies with its value, and the values of other model parameters. See Saltelli et al (2004; 2008) for an excellent coverage of these methods.
Global sensitivity analysis can support environmental modeling in at least the following ways.
1.  Once it is recognized that some parameters affect model outputs to only a limited extent, these parameters can be fixed at user-specified values while others are estimated through calibration. This can accrue considerable numerical savings in the calibration of models whose run times are long.
2.  Global sensitivity analysis may support construction of a simple model in place of a more complex one for use in calibration, uncertainty analysis and decision support.
3.  By establishing the parameters that are important, and the interactions between parameters that are important, much can be learned about the system which a model attempts to simulate. This information can sharpen the intuition of those who must manage that system.
PESTPP-SEN currently supports two GSA methods. These are
1.  the Method of Morris (Morris, 1991), with extensions proposed by Campolongo et al (2005), and
2.  the Method of Sobol (Sobol, 2001).
The Method of Morris is a “one-at-a-time” method (Saltelli et al, 2004). It is computationally efficient and is therefore suitable for use with models whose run times are high. It provides estimates of the first two moments (mean and variance) of the effect that each parameter has on a model output of interest. These statistics acknowledge that a parameter’s sensitivity may be a function not just of its own value, but of the values of other parameters. In doing so, they reveal those parameters that have the most influence on model outputs of interest, and the consistency of these influences over parameter space. The information that it provides may justify the omission of some parameters from a calibration exercise; and/or it may support the design of a simple, fast-running, surrogate model. In contrast, the Method of Sobol has the potential to provide much more detailed information than the Method of Morris. Because it is based on decomposition of variance (Saltelli et al, 2004), it can reveal details of parameter nonlinearity that are beyond the reach of other methods. It can also reveal complex parameter interactions and, by inference, interaction of the processes to which these parameters pertain. Unfortunately, this information comes with a high computational cost. Hence unless Sobol-based global sensitivity analysis is restricted to only a few parameters and a relatively fast-running model, it is generally computationally unaffordable.
IMPORTANT: Note that PESTPP-SEN records phi and group phi sensitivity metrics and these phi metrics rely on the weights in the \* observation data section of the control file. As such, if all observations have zero weight, then the phi and group phi summary metrics will be zero. PESTPP-SEN tries to counter this problem by resetting all weights to 1.0 if all weights are zero. Otherwise, it is up to users to make sure the weights are appropriate for summarizing phi sensitivities.

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** PEST's sensitivity reuse feature in Chapter 7 reduces model runs by skipping low-sensitivity parameter recalculations, but is cautioned against for nonlinear problems. SVD-assist is a preferable alternative, with sensitivities recomputed every N iterations. Broyden updating remains active. DOSENREUSE in "control data" toggles this feature, with SENRELTHRESH, SENMAXREUSE, SENALLCALCINT, SENPREDWEIGHT, and SENPIEXCLUDE offering customization options.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST's sensitivity reuse functionality (Chapter 7) reduces model runs by skipping recalculation of low-sensitivity parameters, but is not generally recommended, especially for nonlinear problems;  SVD-assist offers a better alternative. Sensitivities are recomputed every N iterations (user-defined).  Broyden updating still occurs regardless of the setting.

- **Previous Summary:** Table 6.3 shows optional PESTPP-GLM control variables (with defaults):  `der_forgive()`, `enforce_tied_bounds()`, `glm_accept_mc_phi()`, `rand_seed()`, `glm_rebase_super()`, `glm_iter_mc()`, `ensemble_output_precision()`, and `glm_norm_form()`.  These control derivative handling, bound enforcement, Monte Carlo acceptance, random seed, super parameter re-basing, iterative Monte Carlo, ensemble output precision, and normal matrix form.  Parallel run management variables (section 5.3.6) can also be used.
- **Next Summary:** To analyze parameter group sensitivities, tie all but one group member to the remaining parameter (the parent).  Alternatively, use the *tie_by_group()* control variable.  Ensure tied parameter values are realistic;  tied parameters' bounds are calculated at the start (reported to the run record file) to maintain bounds.  Global sensitivity analysis assesses joint sensitivity.

### Summary
**The five-point method with α and β from equations 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 is preferred when model outputs contain numerical noise from convergence difficulties or other factors.  This often motivates using four runs per parameter per iteration.**

### Header
**3.5.2 Forward, Central and Five-Point Differences**

### Content
The latter choice is far better where model outputs are contaminated by numerical noise that may arise from model solution convergence difficulties and other factors. It would normally be to address this problem that a modeller would even consider undertaking four runs per parameter per iteration.

It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.
- **Detailed Summary:** PEST calculates Jacobian matrix elements using finite differences unless provided by the model. Accurate derivatives are crucial, managed by SVD or LSQR for ill-posedness. Parameters are grouped for derivative calculation management. PEST offers forward, central, and five-point finite-difference methods, with central methods providing higher accuracy. Model-calculated derivatives are preferred for accuracy and speed.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** PEST calculates derivatives using forward (one model run per parameter), central (two runs), or five-point (four runs) finite-difference methods. Central methods (outside points, parabolic, least-squares) offer higher accuracy than forward differences. Five-point methods use equation 3.5.1, with α and β from equations 3.5.2-3.5.5 for precision or minimum error variance.
- **Next Summary:** PEST offers "absolute," "relative," and "rel_to_max" parameter increment types (INCTYP, DERINC).  "Relative" and "rel_to_max" adjust increments based on parameter values; DERINCLB provides a minimum increment.  Increments must allow distinguishing incremented and non-incremented parameter values in the model input file.  Increments cannot exceed the parameter range divided by 3.2.

### Summary
**Regularization best addresses problems caused by insensitive parameters in unregularized inversions. Alternatively, temporarily holding troublesome parameters (identified via the parameter sensitivity file) at their current values, may allow the objective function to improve.  This process may need to be repeated for multiple parameters.**

### Header
**6.2.2 Fixing the Problem**

### Content
As stated above, this problem is most easily fixed by introducing regularisation to the inverse problem. Another (older and no longer recommended) solution to this problem is to hold parameters which are identified as being troublesome at their current values, at least for a while. With such recalcitrant parameters “out of the road”, PEST can often achieve a significant improvement in the objective function. Such temporarily held parameters can then be brought back into the parameter estimation process at a later date.
It may be found that quite a few parameters need to be held in this manner, for once a particular troublesome parameter has been identified and held, it may be found that the problem does not go away because another insensitive parameter then dominates the parameter upgrade vector. When that parameter is held, yet another troublesome parameter may be identified, and so on. All such parameters can be temporarily held at their current values if desired. A user may hold such parameters one by one as they are identified in the manner described above, or he/she may prefer instead to take the pre-emptive measure of temporarily holding at their current values all parameters identified in the parameter sensitivity file as being particularly insensitive, and hence potentially troublesome.

- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers
- **Main Section:** 6. Intervention
- **Subsection:** 6.2 User Intervention

### Additional Summaries
- **Higher-Level Summary:** Chapter 6 discusses automatic user intervention in PEST for regularization methods in parameter estimation. It suggests identifying and temporarily fixing insensitive parameters to improve matrix condition number and objective function. Parameters like DOAUI and MAXAUI customize intervention behavior, with options for mitigating bad derivatives and improving sensitivity.
- **Detailed Summary:** In unregularized inversions, insensitive parameters can lead to large adjustments beyond set limits, resulting in minimal objective function improvement. Increasing limits may not help; regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity is recommended. Use the parameter sensitivity file to identify insensitive parameters and consider temporarily holding them at current values using the case.hld file.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** In unregularized, highly parameterized inversions, insensitive parameters may cause large adjustments exceeding change limits (RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, ABSPARMAX(N)), resulting in minimal objective function reduction. Increasing these limits may not solve the problem; instead, consider regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity.  The parameter sensitivity file (section 5.3.3) helps identify insensitive parameters.
- **Next Summary:** A case.hld file (Figure 6.1) allows modifying RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, LAMBDA, UPVECBEND, and "predictive analysis" variables.  It can temporarily hold parameters ("hold parameter"), parameter groups ("hold group"), or eigenvectors ("hold eigenvector") at their current values.  Ignored lines include comments (#) and incorrect entries.  The file must be deleted after use.

The *opt_constraint_groups* variable (comma-separated list) can override this. Zero weights disable constraints;  positive weights (if *opt_std_weights(true)*) are treated as standard deviations. At least one model output constraint is required; otherwise, PESTPP-OPT halts.**\n\n### Header\n**8.2.4 Constraints**\n\n### Content\nConstraints can be applied on model outputs (read from model output files using instruction files) or on prior information equations. PESTPP-OPT allows constraints to be either “less than” or “greater than” constraints; the latter are internally reformulated as “less than” constraints to meet the demands of the linear programming algorithm that it implements. Constraints are identified using observation groups. If an observation group contains “less than” constraints, then its name must begin with “l\\_” (that is, the letter “el” followed by an underscore) or “less\\_”; if an observation group contains “greater than” constraints then its name must begin with “g\\_” or “greater\\_”. Do not forget that prior information equations are also assigned to observation groups.\nWhile the naming of observation groups in this way is sufficient to denote them as containing constraints, you can also nominate groups which contain constraints using the *opt_constraint_groups()* control variable. The value of this control variable is a comma-delimited set of observation groups. The name of each such group must begin with “l\\_” or “g\\_” (or “less\\_” or “greater\\_”) in accordance with the protocol described above so that PESTPP-OPT knows what type of constraints they are. If an *opt_constraint_groups()* keyword is supplied, and if a group name that begins with “l\\_” or “g\\_” (or “less\\_” or “greater”) is omitted from the list of groups supplied through this variable, then members of that group do not comprise optimization constraints. They are therefore observations which comprise part of the calibration dataset (unless the pertinent observations are assigned weights of zero in the PEST control file).\nIt is important to note that weights assigned in the PEST control file to model outputs to which constraints are applied have no bearing on their operation, unless they are set to zero. If the weight associated with a constraint is set to zero, then the constraint is disabled. However, if the weight is positive, its value does not affect the strength with which the constraint is applied, with one exception: if the *opt_std_weights()* option is used, then the weight values for the non-zero weight constraints are treated as standard deviations (uncertainty) for use in the chance constraint process. This option can help speed up the repeated application of PESTPP-OPT by allowing users to pre-calculate constraint uncertainty through application of PREDUNC, pyEMU or through empirical constraint uncertainty estimation via ensembles. In this way, PESTPP-OPT does not need to solve any linear analysis equations and instead simply uses these standard deviations directly.\nIn the simplex algorithm, all constraints are “hard”. It is the nature of most constrained optimization problems that the solution to that problem lies at a “corner” of decision variable space that is defined by the intersection of constraint surfaces. In that corner, at least one constraint specification is exactly met.\nIn addition to constraints applied to model outputs and prior information equations, the upper and lower bounds on decision variables supplied in the “parameter data” section of a PEST control file comprise a further set of constraints which are respected by the constrained optimization process that is implemented by PESTPP-OPT. Obviously, these are applied to each decision variable individually.\nAs presently programmed, PESTPP-OPT requires that at least one constraint be applied to a model output. Hence if the only constraints that are specified in a PEST control file that is read by PESTPP-OPT are those on individual decision variables through their bounds, and/or on prior information equations that feature those decision variables, PESTPP-OPT will cease execution with an appropriate message.\n\n### Source\n- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis\n- **Main Section:** 8.

It requires accurate derivatives, a prior calibration process, and parameter consistency with the estimation run. Users can adjust Marquardt lambda, search parameters, and incorporate predictive noise for improved analysis.\n- **Detailed Summary:** In \"predictive analysis\" mode, PEST maximizes/minimizes a prediction (in the \"predict\" group) while keeping the objective function ≤ Φ0 (requires a prior \"estimation\" run).  It uses the same parameters, transformations, and observations as the estimation run.  Restarting uses `/r`, `/j`, `/d`, or `/s` (parallel runs).  Change limits remain important.  Screen output shows prediction values per iteration.  Results include the optimal prediction and parameter values.\n\n### Related Context\n- **Previous Summary:** *opt_obj_func* (prior information equation, file—Figure 8.1, or observation) defines PESTPP-OPT's objective function (Equation 8.4). *opt_direction* (\"min\" or \"max\") sets optimization direction.  If *opt_obj_func* is absent, coefficients default to 1.0.  The file must list all decision variables and their coefficients (space, tab, or comma-delimited; comment lines are ignored).\n- **Next Summary:** PESTPP-OPT uses observations (excluding zero-weighted ones) and sensitivities (from the JCO file) for notional calibration (Equations 8.1-8.3), calculating posterior parameter uncertainties. Weights are inversely proportional to measurement noise standard deviations (PWTADJ2 can adjust weights); the objective function should approximate the number of non-zero-weighted observations.  Prior information equations are ignored unless they contain decision variables.  Zero weights omit observations from calibration;  a user-supplied posterior covariance matrix can replace the prior one.\n\n### Metadata\n- **Keywords:** \n- **Chunk ID:** 3d0667287a5c\n- **Chunk Index:** 1\n- **Previous Chunk ID:** 4dcf3c55ac23\n- **Next Chunk ID:** e7440583ae79\n\n---\n\nDebug Factors:\n- Base Score: 0.700\n- Length Factor: 1.00\n- Variation Factor: 1.50\n- Final Score: 1.050\n- Found in 5 variations\n\n## Context\n\n### Summary\n**Poor PESTPP-GLM or PESTPP-OPT performance may indicate issues with finite-difference derivatives.

It uses Jacobian matrices and Marquardt lambda for parameter estimation. Different methods are employed based on problem types, with options for uncertainty analysis and parallel processing to reduce computational costs.\n\n### Related Context\n- **Previous Summary:** Maximize model output precision (especially for PESTPP-GLM/PESTPP-OPT) by adjusting model control variables to prioritize precision over speed. Tighten solver convergence criteria but avoid excessively long runtimes. Larger parameter increments and three-point derivative methods (parabolic or best-fit) can mitigate granular outputs from adaptive time-stepping or model algorithms.  Precise inter-submodel data transfer is also crucial for composite models.\n- **Next Summary:** PEST and PEST++ programs store Jacobian matrices (sensitivities of model outputs to parameters) in binary JCO files (case.jco).  Columns represent parameters; rows represent observations. Log-transformed parameters use log-based derivatives. Utilities (JACWRIT, JCO2MAT, JROW2VEC, JCO2JCO, and PyEMU) provide ASCII conversion, manipulation, and subsetting. JCO files are used for sensitivity analysis, calibration (using the `/i` switch in PEST or *base_jacobian()* in PESTPP-GLM), and linear analyses (identifiability, uncertainty, data worth, model defects).  NOPTMAX=-1 or -2 generates JCO files only.\n\n### Metadata\n- **Keywords:** \n- **Chunk ID:** 906e5691bc49\n- **Chunk Index:** 1\n- **Previous Chunk ID:** 1bd7e570c0b5\n- **Next Chunk ID:** 4b9812b58a08\n\n---\n\nDebug Factors:\n- Base Score: 0.645\n- Length Factor: 0.70\n- Variation Factor: 1.50\n- Final Score: 0.678\n- Found in 5 variations\n\n## Context\n\n### Summary\n**PESTPP-SEN performs global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using Morris' (Morris 1991, Campolongo et al 2005) or Sobol's (Sobol 2001) methods (Saltelli et al 2004, 2008). Morris' method (efficient for slow models) provides mean and variance of parameter effects; Sobol's method (computationally expensive) reveals parameter nonlinearity and interactions.  GSA helps simplify models, identify important parameters, and improve intuition.  If all observation weights are zero, PESTPP-SEN resets them to 1.0 before calculating phi and group phi sensitivities.**\n\n### Header\n**7.1.1 General**\n\n### Content\nThe purpose of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is to characterize how model parameters affect model outputs (or a function of model outputs such as an objective function) over a wide range of acceptable parameter values. In doing this, it strives for greater robustness, and for the provision of more information, than local sensitivity analysis based on partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. Because local sensitivity analysis pertains to a single point in parameter space, the information that it yields is often insufficient to support an understanding of the behavior of nonlinear models whose outputs depend on combinations of model parameters in complicated and parameter-value-dependent ways.\nThe information provided by global sensitivity analysis differs widely between the different methodologies that implement it. In general, the more information that a global sensitivity analysis method provides, the greater is its computational burden. This information can vary from a simple measure of the influence that each parameter has on selected model outputs, to a complete description of how a parameter’s influence varies with its value, and the values of other model parameters. See Saltelli et al (2004; 2008) for an excellent coverage of these methods.\nGlobal sensitivity analysis can support environmental modeling in at least the following ways.\n1.  Once it is recognized that some parameters affect model outputs to only a limited extent, these parameters can be fixed at user-specified values while others are estimated through calibration. This can accrue considerable numerical savings in the calibration of models whose run times are long.\n2.  Global sensitivity analysis may support construction of a simple model in place of a more complex one for use in calibration, uncertainty analysis and decision support.\n3.  By establishing the parameters that are important, and the interactions between parameters that are important, much can be learned about the system which a model attempts to simulate. This information can sharpen the intuition of those who must manage that system.\nPESTPP-SEN currently supports two GSA methods. These are\n1.  the Method of Morris (Morris, 1991), with extensions proposed by Campolongo et al (2005), and\n2.  the Method of Sobol (Sobol, 2001).\nThe Method of Morris is a “one-at-a-time” method (Saltelli et al, 2004). It is computationally efficient and is therefore suitable for use with models whose run times are high. It provides estimates of the first two moments (mean and variance) of the effect that each parameter has on a model output of interest. These statistics acknowledge that a parameter’s sensitivity may be a function not just of its own value, but of the values of other parameters. In doing so, they reveal those parameters that have the most influence on model outputs of interest, and the consistency of these influences over parameter space. The information that it provides may justify the omission of some parameters from a calibration exercise; and/or it may support the design of a simple, fast-running, surrogate model. In contrast, the Method of Sobol has the potential to provide much more detailed information than the Method of Morris. Because it is based on decomposition of variance (Saltelli et al, 2004), it can reveal details of parameter nonlinearity that are beyond the reach of other methods. It can also reveal complex parameter interactions and, by inference, interaction of the processes to which these parameters pertain. Unfortunately, this information comes with a high computational cost. Hence unless Sobol-based global sensitivity analysis is restricted to only a few parameters and a relatively fast-running model, it is generally computationally unaffordable.\nIMPORTANT: Note that PESTPP-SEN records phi and group phi sensitivity metrics and these phi metrics rely on the weights in the \\* observation data section of the control file. As such, if all observations have zero weight, then the phi and group phi summary metrics will be zero. PESTPP-SEN tries to counter this problem by resetting all weights to 1.0 if all weights are zero. Otherwise, it is up to users to make sure the weights are appropriate for summarizing phi sensitivities.\n\n### Source\n- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation: PEST++ a Software Suite for Parameter Estimation, Uncertainty Analysis, Management Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis\n- **Main Section:** 7. PESTPP-SEN\n- **Subsection:** 7.1 Introduction\n\n### Additional Summaries\n- **Higher-Level Summary:** PEST's sensitivity reuse feature in Chapter 7 reduces model runs by skipping low-sensitivity parameter recalculations, but is cautioned against for nonlinear problems. SVD-assist is a preferable alternative, with sensitivities recomputed every N iterations. Broyden updating remains active. DOSENREUSE in \"control data\" toggles this feature, with SENRELTHRESH, SENMAXREUSE, SENALLCALCINT, SENPREDWEIGHT, and SENPIEXCLUDE offering customization options.\n- **Detailed Summary:** PEST's sensitivity reuse functionality (Chapter 7) reduces model runs by skipping recalculation of low-sensitivity parameters, but is not generally recommended, especially for nonlinear problems;  SVD-assist offers a better alternative. Sensitivities are recomputed every N iterations (user-defined).  Broyden updating still occurs regardless of the setting.\n\n### Related Context\n- **Previous Summary:** Table 6.3 shows optional PESTPP-GLM control variables (with defaults):  `der_forgive()`, `enforce_tied_bounds()`, `glm_accept_mc_phi()`, `rand_seed()`, `glm_rebase_super()`, `glm_iter_mc()`, `ensemble_output_precision()`, and `glm_norm_form()`.  These control derivative handling, bound enforcement, Monte Carlo acceptance, random seed, super parameter re-basing, iterative Monte Carlo, ensemble output precision, and normal matrix form.  Parallel run management variables (section 5.3.6) can also be used.\n- **Next Summary:** To analyze parameter group sensitivities, tie all but one group member to the remaining parameter (the parent).  Alternatively, use the *tie_by_group()* control variable.  Ensure tied parameter values are realistic;  tied parameters' bounds are calculated at the start (reported to the run record file) to maintain bounds.  Global sensitivity analysis assesses joint sensitivity.\n\n### Metadata\n- **Keywords:** * observation data\n- **Chunk ID:** 29e5bbaa408c\n- **Chunk Index:** 1\n- **Previous Chunk ID:** 84e093247de5\n- **Next Chunk ID:** 3a16626e5778\n\n---\n\nDebug Factors:\n- Base Score: 0.447\n- Length Factor: 1.00\n- Variation Factor: 1.40\n- Final Score: 0.625\n- Found in 4 variations\n\n## Context\n\n### Summary\n**The five-point method with α and β from equations 3.5.4 and 3.5.5 is preferred when model outputs contain numerical noise from convergence difficulties or other factors.

It uses control files with specific sections and options for parameter adjustments, transformations, and derivative calculations. PEST generates Jacobian matrices and offers utilities for file manipulation and sensitivity analysis.\n- **Detailed Summary:** PEST calculates Jacobian matrix elements using finite differences unless provided by the model. Accurate derivatives are crucial, managed by SVD or LSQR for ill-posedness. Parameters are grouped for derivative calculation management. PEST offers forward, central, and five-point finite-difference methods, with central methods providing higher accuracy. Model-calculated derivatives are preferred for accuracy and speed.\n\n### Related Context\n- **Previous Summary:** PEST calculates derivatives using forward (one model run per parameter), central (two runs), or five-point (four runs) finite-difference methods. Central methods (outside points, parabolic, least-squares) offer higher accuracy than forward differences. Five-point methods use equation 3.5.1, with α and β from equations 3.5.2-3.5.5 for precision or minimum error variance.\n- **Next Summary:** PEST offers \"absolute,\" \"relative,\" and \"rel_to_max\" parameter increment types (INCTYP, DERINC).  \"Relative\" and \"rel_to_max\" adjust increments based on parameter values; DERINCLB provides a minimum increment.  Increments must allow distinguishing incremented and non-incremented parameter values in the model input file.  Increments cannot exceed the parameter range divided by 3.2.\n\n### Metadata\n- **Keywords:** \n- **Chunk ID:** 1813ccd458a7\n- **Chunk Index:** 2\n- **Previous Chunk ID:** 84d79eb825ab\n- **Next Chunk ID:** 4b27f7aae10c\n\n---\n\nDebug Factors:\n- Base Score: 0.700\n- Length Factor: 0.70\n- Variation Factor: 1.10\n- Final Score: 0.539\n- Found in 1 variations\n\n## Context\n\n### Summary\n**Regularization best addresses problems caused by insensitive parameters in unregularized inversions. Alternatively, temporarily holding troublesome parameters (identified via the parameter sensitivity file) at their current values, may allow the objective function to improve.  This process may need to be repeated for multiple parameters.**\n\n### Header\n**6.2.2 Fixing the Problem**\n\n### Content\nAs stated above, this problem is most easily fixed by introducing regularisation to the inverse problem. Another (older and no longer recommended) solution to this problem is to hold parameters which are identified as being troublesome at their current values, at least for a while. With such recalcitrant parameters “out of the road”, PEST can often achieve a significant improvement in the objective function. Such temporarily held parameters can then be brought back into the parameter estimation process at a later date.\nIt may be found that quite a few parameters need to be held in this manner, for once a particular troublesome parameter has been identified and held, it may be found that the problem does not go away because another insensitive parameter then dominates the parameter upgrade vector. When that parameter is held, yet another troublesome parameter may be identified, and so on. All such parameters can be temporarily held at their current values if desired. A user may hold such parameters one by one as they are identified in the manner described above, or he/she may prefer instead to take the pre-emptive measure of temporarily holding at their current values all parameters identified in the parameter sensitivity file as being particularly insensitive, and hence potentially troublesome.\n\n### Source\n- **File Name:** PEST Model-Independent Parameter Estimation. User Manual Part I: PEST, SENSAN and Global Optimisers\n- **Main Section:** 6. Intervention\n- **Subsection:** 6.2 User Intervention\n\n### Additional Summaries\n- **Higher-Level Summary:** Chapter 6 discusses automatic user intervention in PEST for regularization methods in parameter estimation. It suggests identifying and temporarily fixing insensitive parameters to improve matrix condition number and objective function. Parameters like DOAUI and MAXAUI customize intervention behavior, with options for mitigating bad derivatives and improving sensitivity.\n- **Detailed Summary:** In unregularized inversions, insensitive parameters can lead to large adjustments beyond set limits, resulting in minimal objective function improvement. Increasing limits may not help; regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity is recommended. Use the parameter sensitivity file to identify insensitive parameters and consider temporarily holding them at current values using the case.hld file.\n\n### Related Context\n- **Previous Summary:** In unregularized, highly parameterized inversions, insensitive parameters may cause large adjustments exceeding change limits (RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, ABSPARMAX(N)), resulting in minimal objective function reduction. Increasing these limits may not solve the problem; instead, consider regularization or adjusting parameter sensitivity.  The parameter sensitivity file (section 5.3.3) helps identify insensitive parameters.\n- **Next Summary:** A case.hld file (Figure 6.1) allows modifying RELPARMAX, FACPARMAX, LAMBDA, UPVECBEND, and \"predictive analysis\" variables.  It can temporarily hold parameters (\"hold parameter\"), parameter groups (\"hold group\"), or eigenvectors (\"hold eigenvector\") at their current values.
