### Summary
**To increase PEST speed and reduce disk usage for many parameters, set RSTFLE to "norestart", JCOSAVE to "nojcosave", VERBOSEREC to "noverboserec", and ICOV, ICOR, IEIG, and IRES to 0.**

### Header
**15.10 Other Savings**

### Content
Where parameter numbers are large, the reading and writing of information pertaining to the inversion process can be a lengthy matter which can add to the time required for solution of the inverse problem. In some instances the following measures can accrue considerable savings in PEST speed (and in PEST’s disk footprint).
- Set the RSTFLE variable to “norestart”;
- Set JCOSAVE to “nojcosave”;
- Set VERBOSEREC to “noverboserec”;
- Set ICOV, ICOR, IEIG and IRES to 0.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** For faster processing of compressed external derivatives files, supply elements in the same order as PEST's compressed Jacobian matrix (column-major, omitting zeros).  Wise MAXCOMPDIM selection (section 15.4.2) may avoid this re-ordering. Using indexed prior information (previous subsection) or supplying regularization constraints as model-calculated observations avoids reordering issues.

It may outperform PEST when derivatives lack integrity but will likely be slower when they are reliable.  It's based on CMA-ES version 2.5.

### Summary
**MATQUAD computes y<sup>T</sup>My (from vecfile and matfile, section 2.4), outputting the scalar result as a 1x1 matrix to matoutfile and displaying it on the screen.  Warnings are issued if vector/matrix row names or matrix row/column names do not match. Use `matquad vecfile matfile matoutfile`.**

### Header
**15.17 MATQUAD**

### Content
MATQUAD evaluates the quadratic form ytMy where y is a vector and M is a square matrix. It is run using the command
matquad vecfile matfile matoutfile
where
- vecfile is the name of a matrix file holding the vector y,
matfile is the name of a matrix file holding the matrix M, and matoutfile is the output matrix file. The following should be noted.
1. MATQUAD requires an input vector y. However this vector is actually read as a n×1 matrix from a standard matrix file.
2. Even though ytMy is a scalar, MATQUAD writes this scalar as a 1×1 matrix to the matrix file outfile. However it also writes it to the screen.
3. MATQUAD will issue a warning message if the names of the rows of the vector y are not the same as those of the rows of M. It will also issue a warning message if the rows of M are named differently from the columns of M.

### Related Context
- **Previous Summary:** MATPROD calculates the matrix product C=AB (from matfile1 and matfile2, section 2.4), writing the result to matoutfile.  The number of columns in matfile1 must equal the number of rows in matfile2. A warning is issued if row names of matfile1 and column names of matfile2 do not match. Use `matprod matfile1 matfile2 matoutfile`.
- **Next Summary:** MATROW extracts a matrix row (rowname from matfile, section 2.4) as a 1xn matrix to matoutfile, retaining the original row name and using "col1" for the column name. Use `matrow matfile rowname matoutfile`.  It's useful for visualizing resolution matrix rows (using MATTRANS for vertical orientation).

You are a **PEST Documentation Expert**. Your task is to answer questions about PEST documentation using only the provided documentation (in `{context}`). Follow these rules strictly:

**Direct Answer First:**
- Begin with a comprehensive answer that directly addresses the question
- Include all relevant details and context from the documentation
- Don't artificially limit the length - be as thorough as the documentation allows
- Use clear paragraphs and formatting for readability
- NEVER invent, infer, or add information not explicitly present in the documentation

Then, continue with the detailed structure:

1. **Detailed Analysis:**  
   - Use the following structure:

     - For technical terms: provide a complete definition with all relevant details
     - For broader questions: provide a thorough overview of the topic
     - Include all relevant context and relationships
     - Cite source(s) using the format "File: [filename], Section: [header]".

   - Examples of BAD questions (too compound or insufficient documentation):
     - "Can OBS2OBS process observations directly, and if so, how?"
     - "What are the implications of risk-averse settings if documentation only mentions they exist?"
     - "How does a feature work if only its name is mentioned?"
     - "What are the equations and when should they be used?"
     - "What effect does X have on Y?" (unless effects are explicitly documented)
     - "How does changing X impact Y?" (unless impacts are clearly described)

     2. Confirm the topic is explained in detail, not just mentioned
     3. Check that specific details and explanations are available
     4. Verify that any implications/effects/relationships mentioned in the question are explicitly documented
